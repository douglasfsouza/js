# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with their respective symbols (X and O). The player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the Tic Tac Toe game.
- `css/styles.css`: Contains the styles for the Tic Tac Toe game, defining the layout, colors, and appearance of the game board and cells.
- `js/script.js`: Implements the game logic, handling player moves, checking for win conditions, and updating the game board.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the empty cells of the grid to place their marks (X or O).
3. The game will check for a winner after each move. If a player gets three marks in a row, they win!
4. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
