01:24:44.691 --> 01:24:46.484
You live to fight another day.

01:24:46.692 --> 01:24:50.153
What are you talking about?
I put together a great jury.

01:24:50.362 --> 01:24:52.322
It's a disappointment. We have them.

01:24:52.531 --> 01:24:57.410
All of us have them. You use it.
You embrace it. And then you move on.

01:24:59.413 --> 01:25:00.663
Hang on.

01:25:00.998 --> 01:25:02.499
We've gotta talk about this.

01:25:02.707 --> 01:25:05.959
Aw, listen to yourself, Kevin.
"We've gotta talk about this."

01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:07.795
It's your wife, man.

01:25:08.004 --> 01:25:10.005
She's sick, she needs you.

01:25:10.215 --> 01:25:12.174
She's got to come first.

01:25:12.509 --> 01:25:14.009
All right, wait a minute.

01:25:14.219 --> 01:25:18.514
Do you mean the possibility of leaving
this case has never entered your mind?

01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:24.727
You know what scares me?

01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:28.022
I quit the case, she gets better...

01:25:28.899 --> 01:25:30.399
...and I hate her for it.

01:25:31.735 --> 01:25:33.027
I don't want to resent her.

01:25:33.237 --> 01:25:34.570
I've got a winner here.

01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:38.866
I've got to nail this fucker down
and put it behind me. Just get it done.

01:25:39.158 --> 01:25:40.200
Then...

01:25:40.701 --> 01:25:41.827
...then...

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:44.246
...put all my energy into her.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.754
I stand corrected.

01:25:53.463 --> 01:25:56.298
Fill me in. Did Cullen's assistant
admit to the affair?

01:25:56.508 --> 01:26:00.344
She did to me, but she won't in court.

01:26:00.762 --> 01:26:02.054
MILTON:
Convince her otherwise.

01:26:02.472 --> 01:26:05.057
And when all that evidence
is laid before you...

01:26:05.267 --> 01:26:09.395
...when all these pieces weave together,
you will conclude...

01:26:09.603 --> 01:26:10.979
...you will know...

01:26:11.188 --> 01:26:13.773
...that Alexander Cullen is guilty...

01:26:13.983 --> 01:26:16.067
...of murdering three people...

01:26:16.235 --> 01:26:17.819
...in cold blood...

01:26:18.112 --> 01:26:20.488
...and with malice aforethought.

01:26:21.115 --> 01:26:22.198
Thank you.

01:26:23.576 --> 01:26:24.701
Your Honor.

01:26:25.119 --> 01:26:29.414
Mr. Lomax, uh, we can break for lunch now
or you can do a stop and start.

01:26:29.831 --> 01:26:31.790
If it's a choice, I'll go now.

01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:34.293
I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.

01:26:34.502 --> 01:26:35.627
Proceed.

01:26:40.842 --> 01:26:42.926
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

01:26:43.135 --> 01:26:46.929
...I know you've spent all morning
listening to Mr. Broygo talk.

01:26:47.139 --> 01:26:48.347
I know you're hungry.

01:26:48.557 --> 01:26:51.642
What I need to tell you
won't take very long at all.

01:26:52.978 --> 01:26:56.480
I don't like Alexander Cullen.

01:26:56.648 --> 01:26:59.358
I don't think he's a nice person.

01:26:59.525 --> 01:27:01.359
I don't expect you to like him.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.447
He's been a terrible husband
to all three of his wives.

01:27:05.656 --> 01:27:08.658
He's been a destructive force
in the lives of his stepchildren.

01:27:08.868 --> 01:27:10.911
He's cheated the city, his partners...

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.162
...his employees.

01:27:12.371 --> 01:27:15.999
He's paid hundreds of thousands
of dollars in penalties and fines.

01:27:16.208 --> 01:27:18.542
I don't like him.

01:27:19.211 --> 01:27:23.005
I'm going to tell you some things
during the course of this trial...

01:27:23.215 --> 01:27:26.008
...that are going to make you
like him even less.

01:27:26.593 --> 01:27:29.011
But this isn't a popularity contest.

01:27:29.221 --> 01:27:30.721
It's a murder trial.

01:27:31.723 --> 01:27:36.810
And the single most important
provable fact of this proceeding...

01:27:36.977 --> 01:27:40.813
...is that Alexander Cullen
was somewhere else...

01:27:41.065 --> 01:27:45.318
...when these horrible crimes took place.

01:27:46.570 --> 01:27:47.987
Now, the State...

01:27:48.405 --> 01:27:50.907
The State is going all out here.

01:27:51.157 --> 01:27:52.783
They've got this whole team here...

01:27:52.951 --> 01:27:55.577
...throwing everything
but the kitchen sink at this case.

01:27:55.787 --> 01:27:57.496
I want one thing from you.

01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:59.081
That's it.

01:27:59.499 --> 01:28:00.666
One thing.

01:28:02.001 --> 01:28:04.336
I want you to ask yourself:

01:28:05.922 --> 01:28:08.048
"Is not liking this man...

01:28:09.591 --> 01:28:11.926
...reason enough...

01:28:12.344 --> 01:28:14.220
...to convict him of murder?"

01:28:17.015 --> 01:28:18.683
Enjoy your lunch.

01:28:19.017 --> 01:28:20.434
We'll talk again.

01:28:22.312 --> 01:28:25.773
What the fuck was that about?
They're going to hate me.

01:28:26.148 --> 01:28:29.192
Listen to me like you've never
listened to anyone before in your life.

01:28:29.402 --> 01:28:31.778
I'm gonna bust my ass
to make sure they hate you.

01:28:31.988 --> 01:28:36.199
Because as long as you're boning Melissa,
you're not home killing your wife.

01:28:38.286 --> 01:28:40.537
Why didn't you say something before?

01:28:41.288 --> 01:28:43.455
Then it doesn't look spontaneous.

01:28:45.959 --> 01:28:47.334
Oh, you got it now?

01:28:57.386 --> 01:29:01.014
- Hey. Kevin.
- Eddie.

01:29:01.223 --> 01:29:02.473
Saw you go in.

01:29:02.683 --> 01:29:03.725
What's up?

01:29:03.934 --> 01:29:05.601
Congratulations.

01:29:05.811 --> 01:29:09.522
- It's not over yet.
- I'm not talking about the trial.

01:29:09.732 --> 01:29:11.065
What are you talking about?

01:29:11.233 --> 01:29:14.569
How the fuck does your name
get on the firm's charter?

01:29:15.695 --> 01:29:16.737
What?

01:29:16.946 --> 01:29:18.780
It looks like it's been there for years.

01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:21.700
So now you're a partner.
When did that happen?

01:29:21.909 --> 01:29:25.871
You know, I still am the managing director
of this firm.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.748
You want my job, take me head on.

01:29:27.957 --> 01:29:29.458
You backdoor me one more time...

01:29:29.624 --> 01:29:33.002
...and I'll take your partnership papers
and shove them down your throat!

01:29:33.170 --> 01:29:36.339
I don't know what you're talking about.
I sure don't like your tone.

01:29:36.548 --> 01:29:39.175
- Ah, bullshit.
- You got a problem with documents...

01:29:39.384 --> 01:29:42.386
...put together one of your
late-night shredding sessions.

01:29:43.472 --> 01:29:45.056
Ah.

01:29:47.516 --> 01:29:50.143
You think you're tough enough
to run this firm?

01:29:50.311 --> 01:29:53.980
Ha! Remember the Weaver Commission
investigation?

01:29:54.190 --> 01:29:55.815
Tell your mentor...

01:29:56.025 --> 01:29:59.152
...the next time Weaver calls me,
maybe I'll just...

01:29:59.362 --> 01:30:00.612
...pick up the phone.

01:30:05.658 --> 01:30:07.826
MILTON: Was he drunk?
- I doubt it.

01:30:08.036 --> 01:30:09.578
He was going running.

01:30:10.038 --> 01:30:12.206
What the hell was he talking about?

01:30:13.375 --> 01:30:15.793
Eddie's got himself in trouble again.

01:30:16.628 --> 01:30:20.297
And he wants me to save him.
Only this time, I can't.

01:30:22.299 --> 01:30:24.801
Why does he think I'm after his job?

01:30:24.968 --> 01:30:27.678
You ever have any experience
with manic depression?

01:30:27.846 --> 01:30:30.098
LOMAX: Not directly, no.
- You do now.

01:30:30.307 --> 01:30:33.017
WOMAN [OVER INTERCOM]: 346.
- It's me. Get Eddie Barzoon.

01:30:33.185 --> 01:30:36.104
Uh, he may be out running,
so you might have to page him.

01:30:36.271 --> 01:30:38.481
- It's an emergency.
WOMAN: Yes, sir.

01:30:38.648 --> 01:30:40.774
You look like you could use a drink.

01:30:40.942 --> 01:30:42.818
Yes. Yes, thanks.

01:30:42.985 --> 01:30:47.322
MILTON:
Eddie Barzoon, Eddie Barzoon. Ha.

01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:51.451
I nursed him through two divorces,
a cocaine rehab...

01:30:51.619 --> 01:30:54.037
...and a pregnant receptionist.

01:30:55.038 --> 01:30:57.164
Ha. God's creature, right?

01:30:57.332 --> 01:30:59.583
God's special creature?

01:30:59.793 --> 01:31:00.876
[CHUCKLES]

01:31:01.044 --> 01:31:02.711
I've warned him, Kevin.

01:31:02.879 --> 01:31:05.047
I've warned him every step of the way.

01:31:05.257 --> 01:31:07.758
Watching him bounce around
like a fucking game.

01:31:07.968 --> 01:31:09.343
Like a wind-up toy.

01:31:09.553 --> 01:31:11.178
Like 250 pounds...

01:31:11.345 --> 01:31:14.222
...of self-serving greed on wheels.

01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:17.475
The next thousand years
is right around the corner, Kevin.

01:31:17.643 --> 01:31:18.893
Eddie Barzoon.

01:31:19.061 --> 01:31:20.687
- Take a good look because...
- Excuse me.

01:31:20.896 --> 01:31:24.732
MILTON: He's the poster child
for the next millennium.

01:31:25.484 --> 01:31:29.279
These people, it's no mystery
where they come from.

01:31:31.948 --> 01:31:35.033
You sharpen the human appetite...

01:31:35.243 --> 01:31:38.954
...to the point where it can split atoms
with its desire.

01:31:39.205 --> 01:31:41.832
You build egos the size of cathedrals.

01:31:42.041 --> 01:31:45.961
Fiber-optically connect the world
to every eager impulse.

[CHUCKLES]

01:31:47.337 --> 01:31:50.214
Grease even the dullest dreams
with these dollar-green...

01:31:50.382 --> 01:31:54.427
...gold-plated fantasies until every human
becomes an aspiring emperor...

01:31:54.595 --> 01:31:57.388
...becomes his own god.
Where can you go from there?

01:31:57.556 --> 01:32:01.392
- Hey. Wrong way.
- Yeah, yeah. Fuck you...

01:32:01.559 --> 01:32:02.976
MILTON:
As we're scrambling...

01:32:03.144 --> 01:32:06.480
...from one deal to the next,
who's got his eye on the planet?

01:32:06.647 --> 01:32:08.648
As the air thickens, the water sours...

01:32:08.858 --> 01:32:12.152
...even bees' honey takes on
the metallic taste of radioactivity...

01:32:12.361 --> 01:32:15.113
...and it just keeps coming,
faster and faster.

01:32:15.323 --> 01:32:18.116
Oh, fuck! Help! Stop it!

01:32:18.325 --> 01:32:20.826
MILTON:
There's no chance to think, to prepare.

01:32:20.994 --> 01:32:23.662
It's buy futures, sell futures...

01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:25.748
...when there is no future.

01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:27.791
We got a runaway train, boy.

01:32:28.001 --> 01:32:32.004
We got a billion Eddie Barzoons
all jogging into the future.

01:32:32.172 --> 01:32:35.925
Every one of them is getting ready
to fistfuck God's ex-planet...

01:32:36.091 --> 01:32:37.634
...lick their fingers clean...

01:32:37.801 --> 01:32:41.387
...as they reach out toward their pristine,
cybernetic keyboards...

01:32:41.597 --> 01:32:43.932
...to tote up their fucking billable hours.

01:32:44.099 --> 01:32:45.767
And then it hits home.

01:32:47.186 --> 01:32:49.103
You gotta pay your own way, Eddie.

...your eyes are bloodshot and
you're screaming for someone to help.

No.

Maybe it's true.
Maybe God threw the dice once too often.

Maybe he let us all down.

01:33:38.693 --> 01:33:41.486
LOMAX: You testified
the defendant called you at 4:30...

01:33:41.695 --> 01:33:45.155
...to ask you to come to his office gym
for the purposes of sex.

01:33:45.365 --> 01:33:46.407
Yes.

Mr. Cullen, though,
he's not just your lover, is he?

He's the boss.

So two hours go by
before you act on his request?

Yes, I went up at 6: 10.

- Who are you?
- Who am I?

01:58:46.775 --> 01:58:48.275
Who are you?

01:58:49.277 --> 01:58:51.487
Never lost a case.

01:58:52.739 --> 01:58:53.906
Why?

01:58:54.074 --> 01:58:56.242
Why do you think?

01:58:56.868 --> 01:58:59.120
Because you're so fucking good.

01:58:59.287 --> 01:59:00.830
Yeah?

01:59:01.288 --> 01:59:02.998
But why?

01:59:04.250 --> 01:59:06.376
Because you're my father?

01:59:06.544 --> 01:59:09.254
I'm a little more than that, Kevin.

01:59:09.505 --> 01:59:12.549
Awfully hot in that courtroom, wasn't it?

01:59:12.717 --> 01:59:15.468
"What's the game plan, Kevin?"

01:59:16.177 --> 01:59:17.720
"It was a nice run, Kev."

"Had to close out some day."

"Nobody wins them all."

What are you?

01:59:26.896 --> 01:59:28.355
Oh.

01:59:28.523 --> 01:59:30.649
I have so many names.

Satan.

Call me Dad.

Mary Ann, she knew it.

01:59:43.746 --> 01:59:46.664
She knew it. She knew it,
so you destroyed her.

01:59:46.832 --> 01:59:49.625
You're blaming me for Mary Ann?

01:59:49.792 --> 01:59:51.877
Oh, I hope you're kidding.

Mary Ann, you could have
saved her anytime you liked.

01:59:54.964 --> 01:59:56.423
All she wanted was love.

Hey, you were too busy.

01:59:58.801 --> 01:59:59.843
That's a lie.

Mary Ann in New York?

Face it, you started looking to
better-deal her the minute you got here.

That's not true.
You don't know what we had.

- Hey, I'm on your side.

- You're a liar!
- No, hey... Kevin.

There's nothing out there for you.

02:00:16.359 --> 02:00:19.445
Don't be such a fucking chump.

02:00:19.613 --> 02:00:22.239
Stop deluding yourself.

02:00:23.324 --> 02:00:25.742
I told you to take care of your wife.

02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:27.035
What did I say?

02:00:27.244 --> 02:00:30.789
"The world would understand."
Didn't I say that?

02:00:30.956 --> 02:00:32.624
What did you do?

[IN LOMAX'S VOICE]
"You know what scares me, John?

02:00:35.377 --> 02:00:39.881

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Remember?

02:00:42.842 --> 02:00:45.636
I know what you did.
You set me up.

02:00:45.804 --> 02:00:48.097
Who told you to pull out
all the stops on Gettys?

02:00:48.264 --> 02:00:51.517
- Who made that choice?
- It's entrapment. You set me up.

02:00:51.684 --> 02:00:54.186
And Moyez. The direction you took.

02:00:54.395 --> 02:00:58.690
Popes, swamis, snake handlers,
all feeding at the same trough.

02:00:58.857 --> 02:01:01.150
- Whose ideas were those?
- You played me!

02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:02.944
It was a test! Your test!

02:01:03.112 --> 02:01:06.656
And Cullen. Knowing he was guilty.

02:01:06.824 --> 02:01:08.574
Seeing those pictures.

02:01:08.784 --> 02:01:12.620
What did you do?
You put that lying bitch on the stand.

02:01:12.788 --> 02:01:16.040
You brought me in. You put me there.
You made her lie.

02:01:16.207 --> 02:01:17.874
I don't do that, Kevin!

02:01:18.042 --> 02:01:20.919
That day on the subway,
what did I say to you?

02:01:21.087 --> 02:01:23.880
What were my words to you?

02:01:24.257 --> 02:01:27.968
Maybe it was your time to lose.
You didn't think so.

02:01:28.136 --> 02:01:30.470
Lose? I don't lose!

02:01:30.637 --> 02:01:33.430
I win!

02:01:33.598 --> 02:01:36.475
I'm a lawyer! That's my job.
That's what I do.

02:01:38.937 --> 02:01:40.980
I rest my case.

02:01:45.402 --> 02:01:46.944
Vanity...

02:01:47.444 --> 02:01:50.155
...is definitely my favorite sin.

02:01:51.532 --> 02:01:54.200
Kevin, it's so basic.

02:01:54.368 --> 02:01:55.952
Self-love.

02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:58.413
The all-natural opiate.

02:01:59.456 --> 02:02:02.959
You know, it's not that you didn't care
for Mary Ann, Kevin...

02:02:03.918 --> 02:02:07.880
...it's just that you were
a little more involved with someone else.

02:02:09.549 --> 02:02:11.258
Yourself.

02:02:14.137 --> 02:02:15.596
You're right.

02:02:15.763 --> 02:02:17.347
I did it all.

I let her go.

02:02:19.058 --> 02:02:23.312
Aw, don't be too hard on yourself, Kevin.
You wanted something more.

Believe me.

I...

02:02:26.190 --> 02:02:28.441
I left her behind and just kept going.

You cannot keep punishing yourself,
Kevin.

02:02:31.278 --> 02:02:34.530
It's awesome how far you've come.

02:02:34.698 --> 02:02:36.699

Don't let him scare you, eh?

MILTON:
Kevin, I've had so many children.

02:03:05.227 --> 02:03:08.395
I've had so many disappointments.

Mistake after mistake.

I want you to be yourself.

I've nurtured every sensation
man has been inspired to have.

I cared about what he wanted
and I never judged him.

Why? Because I never rejected him,
in spite of all his imperfections.
