

2
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:20,957
100,000. Shall we poke our nose
into space, Frank?

3
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,925
That's enough. We're approaching
heat barrier. Let's level off.

4
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:28,462
Recover One, this is Falcon.
Beginning descent now.

5
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:33,902
Roger, Daedalus.

6
00:01:34,106 --> 00:01:35,937
Got you on the scope, Frank.

7
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,540
Miss October.

8
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:05,697
Bing. 110,000th floor,
ladies' lingerie.

9
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,474
You catch that, Hawk?

10
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:14,174
She's all right. She's just
talking to me, that's all.

11
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:15,806
You trust me, don't you?

12
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:18,048
We're taking her down.
That's an order.

13
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,013
Oh, here we go again.

14
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:23,880
Frank.

15
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:25,321
Look at that.

16
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:31,589
That's where we're going.

17
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:35,058
I don't know how
and I don't know when but...

18
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:40,904
Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars

19
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:48,935
Come on, baby.

20
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:55,417
You want to get out
and give us a push?

21
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:11,429
We got to eject!

22
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:14,400
At 112,000 feet?
Are you out of your mind?

23
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:20,538
No choice.
We're not riding this one out.

24
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:23,180
Call mayday!
We're popping! We're popping!

25
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:26,542
- I'm not losing another ship.
- Don't think about it.

26
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:27,843
Just do it!

27
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:35,687
I'll count down to one.
You ready? One.

28
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:51,835
Shit!

29
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:55,908
Crazy son of a bitch almost
landed like a bug on a windshield.

30
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,024
This is it!

31
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,661
First one down wins the prize!

32
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,376
112,000 feet and I feel fine!

33
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:10,216
You've always got to push things
to the limit.

34
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:12,683
That's what I do best, Frank.

35
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,760
Get off me!

36
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:25,195
Come on, you guys! Break it up!

37
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:27,335
Come on.

38
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:42,150
Is that smoke I smell?

39
00:05:42,787 --> 00:05:44,778
Looks like a fire out by Ridgecrest.

40
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:48,792
We crashed the X-2.

41
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:52,726
My 4-million-dollar X-2?

42
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:55,092
Is that the X-2 you're referring to?

43
00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:00,532
We did break both speed
and altitude records, sir.

44
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:04,598
And beat the free-fall mark
by 30,000 feet.

45
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,005
Three planes in ten months.
That's bound to be a record too.

46
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:14,952
The engine failed. The aircraft went
in a flat spin. We couldn't recover.

47
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,614
But you made it.

48
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,680
That's the important thing.

49
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:24,985
And you made it...

50
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:28,666
...just in time, Frank.

51
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,537
Ladies and gentlemen of the press...

52
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:38,675
...I'm Major Bob Gerson, United States
Air Force, and I hold in my hand...

53
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:43,540
...a directive from the president
of the United States of America.

54
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:45,843
It reads:

55
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:49,111
"Effective immediately,
the Air Force's involvement...

56
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:52,187
...in outer atmosphere
testing and exploration...

57
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,187
...is hereby terminated.

58
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,324
A new civilian agency...

59
00:06:56,528 --> 00:07:00,760
...the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, is this day chartered.

60
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:03,935
Project Daedalus is now complete...

61
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:06,433
...and designated
Mission Accomplished."

62
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:08,263
The Air Force is out?

63
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,073
What about the pilots?

64
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:12,708
Who will be
the first American in space?

65
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:16,813
A decision has been made.
After an exhaustive search...

66
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,612
...we've identified who can best
carry out a mission of this magnitude.

67
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,415
This job calls for toughness,
both mental and physical toughness...

68
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:29,081
...and in the tradition of
the best of the Air Force...

69
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:32,189
...an ability to follow orders
to the letter.

70
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:36,261
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet Maryanne...

71
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:39,528
...the first American
to cross into outer space.

72
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:59,685
Look, Frank.
She wants to shake your hand.

73
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:01,288
You bastard.

74
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:05,259
Shake her hand for the cameras, Frank.
That is an order.

75
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,452
It just isn't responding.

76
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,928
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
mission director Sara Holland.

77
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:47,400
She's been monitoring
the situation closely...

78
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:50,574
...and she assures me
that the problem is well in hand.

79
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:54,008
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

80
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:58,114
As you may know, 11 days ago,
atmospheric tracking determined...

81
00:08:58,316 --> 00:09:00,944
...that Russian communications
satellite Ikon...

82
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:03,814
...has initiated orbital degradation.

83
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:06,991
Computer trajectory models
predict a steady acceleration...

84
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:09,717
...in sequence with
the gravitational constant.

85
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:14,058
There's a systems failure in online
navigation and guidance avionics.

86
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:17,029
All redundant systems
are non-responsive.

87
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:21,728
Without active course correction
in the next 30 to 40 days...

88
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,636
...the satellite will reenter
the Earth's atmosphere.

89
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:26,401
And crash?

90
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:29,877
General.

91
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:31,976
Ikon has served you for 14 years.

92
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:35,914
That is in the performance range
of a communications satellite.

93
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:39,716
It will probably crash in the ocean
or burn up in the atmosphere.

94
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,783
I think it's best that we let it.

95
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:50,527
My country's grateful for the efforts
of NASA and the State Department.

96
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:54,171
However, losing Ikon is not an option.

97
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:58,809
Ikon is not just a communications
satellite to the Russian Federation.

98
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:02,477
Ikon is the communications satellite.

99
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:06,848
You are undoubtedly aware
of our restructuring programs.

100
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:09,576
Losing all telecommunications...

101
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:14,451
...until we're able to replace Ikon
could plunge us into chaos.

102
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:16,583
And perhaps...

103
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:18,826
...even civil war.

104
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,664
Hard to believe you fellas
only have one bird up there.

105
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:30,440
Couldn't we just
transfer the workload?

106
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:33,777
Gene. Excuse me, Sara.

107
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:37,610
We have a presidential mandate
to assist the Russians...

108
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:41,152
...our partners in
the International Space Station.

109
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:44,651
And I assure you
that we will fix this problem.

110
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,287
It's just a glitch.

111
00:10:48,126 --> 00:10:50,924
You are feeding these guys
bold-faced lies.

112
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:53,495
It's a waste of money
and my staff's time.

113
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:55,928
Sara, you're one hell
of an engineer...

114
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:58,694
...but you don't know jack-shit
about politics.

115
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,871
Helping the Russians save face
is an act of good faith.

116
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:03,973
How can you put a price on that?

117
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:13,111
This thing is dumb as a post.
It's dead in the air.

118
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:16,718
Kid, why don't you stop trying
to talk to the satellite?

119
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:19,185
You have the code.
Override the guidance system.

120
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:22,956
You want to figure that mess out?

121
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:25,789
The guidance system on this thing
is a dinosaur.

122
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:28,522
Even these guys don't understand it.

123
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,997
It's pre-microprocessor.
It's pre-everything.

124
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:33,466
Whoever designed this
Byzantine piece of shit...

125
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:35,798
...is probably chopping rocks
in Siberia.

126
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:39,170
Ethan, can I access the Skylab files
from here?

127
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:42,838
What does that have
to do with anything?

128
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:48,016
A damn fine politician, but you don't
know jack-shit about engineering.

129
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:51,247
This is the guidance system
from Skylab.

130
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:54,218
That's not possible.

131
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,991
Maybe there's similarities,
but they can't be the same.

132
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:01,092
I'm looking up the designer.

133
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:05,429
Hell. Don't bother.

134
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:09,766
It was Francis D. Corvin.

135
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:11,601
Is he dead?

136
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:15,474
Only if I'm lucky.

137
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:24,049
Would you like me to read
the instructions to you again?

138
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:29,291
Let me tell you something, my dear.

139
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:34,223
A fella in Japan wrote those
instructions when he made this thing.

140
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:37,026
They were probably translated
by some gringo...

141
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:40,727
...an expatriate American who
couldn't get a job in this country.

142
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:46,509
Then a Japanese guy probably
translated him to double-check on him.

143
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:49,937
We don't need these instructions.
Not at all.

144
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:51,679
Tear them up.

145
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:57,280
You know the door to the house
is locked, right?

146
00:12:57,855 --> 00:12:59,755
Well, it's no problem.

147
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:06,456
- You forgot the batteries?
- Yeah.

148
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:10,159
I've got you here in the garage.

149
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:13,929
The smell of gasoline, of fertilizer.

150
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:15,765
What do you say, baby?

151
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:19,704
I'll push you up on this washer
and turn you a few cycles.

152
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:23,439
- I'll turn this washer on...
- Help! Oh, help!

153
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:27,084
I'm locked in the garage
with a dirty old man!

154
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:30,214
- Didn't we do this once 20 years ago?
- Yeah, I know.

155
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:44,698
Dr.Corvin?

156
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:51,709
Yes.

157
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,738
Excuse me, sir,
am I interrupting something?

158
00:13:57,382 --> 00:14:00,215
- Yeah.
- Dr.Corvin, I'm Sara Holland...

159
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:02,409
...and this is astronaut Ethan Glance.

160
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:04,450
We're with NASA.

161
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,820
It was in your car.
I heard someone scream.

162
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,721
Thanks for saving the day.
Now what is it you want?

163
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:15,694
Could we have
a minute of your time?

164
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,358
You should've called ahead of time.
I'm a very busy man.

165
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:24,335
Dr.Corvin, we're here because a
satellite with your guidance system...

166
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:28,740
...is about to reenter the atmosphere.
The system is non-responsive.

167
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:31,747
You want to take a crack at it?

168
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,283
There seems to be an interruption
in the path here.

169
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:40,686
But the circuitry still works.
It's sending us data.

170
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,293
You're losing your uplink.

171
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:48,664
There has to be a problem
in the manual routing drive.

172
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:49,798
I don't think so.

173
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:52,965
That's the consensus
among the engineers.

174
00:14:53,204 --> 00:14:55,695
Same engineers that sent you two here?

175
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,671
Sorry, does that bother you?

176
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:02,778
Yes, it does, actually.

177
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:07,475
Your design predates
all existing guidance systems.

178
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:12,451
It was ahead of its time in '69
but this technology's obsolete now.

179
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:15,387
None of the current engineers
even speak the language...

180
00:15:15,593 --> 00:15:18,255
...and the older guys are all...

181
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:20,560
- ...are...
- Yeah.

182
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:24,861
It wasn't designed for this
duration of duty, that's what.

183
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:27,060
It was designed for the Skylab.

184
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:29,796
My advice is to capture it
and bring it home.

185
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:31,599
It's too big.

186
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:34,777
For the space shuttle?
What kind of bird is it?

187
00:15:35,713 --> 00:15:40,082
It's a Russian
communications satellite.

188
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:43,952
What the hell's my guidance system
doing on a Russian satellite?

189
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:46,419
That's not our primary concern
at this time.

190
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:52,889
Where's it orbiting? Or is that
not your primary concern either?

191
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:54,997
1,000 miles.

192
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:57,592
Rate of decay?

193
00:15:57,902 --> 00:16:01,167
8,000 meters per day and accelerating.

194
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:07,068
It's coming home,
five weeks at the most, I got.

195
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:10,744
NASA's calculations agree.
But here we are.

196
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:14,076
Doctor, you designed this system.

197
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:18,345
If anyone can solve this problem,
it's you.

198
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,297
For a minute there, I thought
you two might be Bob Gerson's lackeys.

199
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:29,092
But your knowledge...

200
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,327
...and your knowledge of history
seems to make that impossible.

201
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:37,273
Gerson's been taking credit
for my work since '58...

202
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:40,876
...when he replaced my ass
with a monkey.

203
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:47,581
You don't work for Gerson, do you?

204
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:52,515
He's a project manager at NASA. He's
one of many assigned to this problem.

205
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:58,524
I think it's time for you two
to head on out of here.

206
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:02,392
- Dr.Corvin, your country needs you.
- Put a sock in it, sonny.

207
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:06,426
Can't fix it from down here and
can't get a team up there in time.

208
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:10,630
That satellite's dying. It'll
come back. My only hope is that...

209
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,971
...whatever doesn't burn up in the
atmosphere lands on Gerson's house.

210
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:23,319
I'll give you two career advice: Stay
away from Gerson, as far as possible.

211
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:28,256
Apparently the buzz on you's correct.

212
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,784
And what buzz is that?

213
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:35,992
You're not a team player.
That's why you washed out at NASA.

214
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:38,393
Get out.

215
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:47,942
We have to brush up
on your hospitality skills.

216
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:36,054
I think I have a solution
for your problem.

217
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:45,463
Frank Corvin.

218
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:49,096
So how long has it been, Frank?

219
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:53,767
Probably not long enough, Bob.

220
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:58,514
Still haven't lost
the Corvin charm, have we?

221
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:02,108
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

222
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:04,216
- Sara?
- No, thanks.

223
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,326
Miss Holland tells me you're
up to speed on our little problem.

224
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:13,163
We've got one sick bird up there.

225
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:19,662
Apparently, there's some kind of
design flaw in the guidance system.

226
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:23,900
This is a hell of a way to get
the designer to help you out.

227
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,435
I heard all about your
initial response.

228
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:31,045
But don't you worry none.
I'm sure we'll come up with something.

229
00:19:31,449 --> 00:19:34,577
Dr.Corvin is here with a solution.

230
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:40,685
Well, praise the Lord and hallelujah.
We are delivered.

231
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:42,754
So...

232
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,492
...tell us about your solution, Frank.

233
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:51,593
Send my team up. We'll fix
your broken satellite for you.

234
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:58,968
- Damn good cup of coffee.
- Do you want to run that by me again?

235
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:01,769
Team Daedalus.

236
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:05,480
Jerry, Hawk, Tank. Send us up.

237
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:09,684
- This is a joke. Am I right?
- It's no joke.

238
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:13,486
We were the best of the best.
Even you'll admit to that.

239
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:16,486
How old are you, Frank?

240
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:20,124
Old enough to know
your ass is in a sling.

241
00:20:21,632 --> 00:20:24,032
Sara,
would you excuse us for a minute?

242
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:26,863
This is about to become
a personal matter.

243
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:39,314
I know you're running out of options.
Otherwise you'd have never come to me.

244
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,618
You sure as hell got that right.

245
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:46,483
You've got a satellite that's gonna
come down in 34 days.

246
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:48,351
Too big to retrieve...

247
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,086
...and for some reason you don't want
it to crash in the atmosphere.

248
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:56,663
I did the design system.
I'm the man to fix it for you.

249
00:20:57,034 --> 00:21:01,300
I don't know how to break this to you,
but you're an old man.

250
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:04,005
Yeah?

251
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:09,539
This old man's all you've got.
You know that and I know that.

252
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:13,843
Hell, you sent up Glenn, didn't you?
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

253
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:17,345
You became a senior citizen
five years ago.

254
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:18,981
Four.

255
00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:24,690
Hell, Frank. For once in your life,
try to be a team player.

256
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,754
Train the crew if you want to.

257
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:30,430
But let the professionals at NASA
fix that design flaw.

258
00:21:31,402 --> 00:21:33,700
There is no flaw.

259
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:38,767
How it got on a Soviet satellite
during the Cold War is the only flaw.

260
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:42,409
How did that happen, Bob?

261
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:45,708
I don't know.

262
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:50,812
This is a hands-on job and I don't
have time to train somebody...

263
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:52,648
...to come up in time.

264
00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:57,091
So you'll just have to
send up Team Daedalus.

265
00:21:57,895 --> 00:22:01,194
- You can take it, or you can leave it.
- All right, all right.

266
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,394
You as a technical advisor, maybe.

267
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,868
But I can't fill up a space shuttle
with geriatrics.

268
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:11,439
You should be professional enough
to know that!

269
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:17,045
Hell, half those boys
are probably dead anyway.

270
00:22:17,481 --> 00:22:21,577
Clock's ticking, Bob.
And I'm only getting older.

271
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:27,315
Okay. You got it.

272
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:28,548
Sir.

273
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:33,763
Mr.Gerson would like you
to wait right here.

274
00:22:42,006 --> 00:22:43,769
Okay, it's a deal.

275
00:22:44,775 --> 00:22:46,265
I want it in writing.

276
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:49,810
Okay.

277
00:22:50,114 --> 00:22:51,911
Now hear my terms.

278
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:57,053
You and your entire crew'll have to
meet the physical requirements.

279
00:22:57,388 --> 00:23:01,347
You'll all train to fix that guidance
system side by side with my people...

280
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:04,053
...in case one of your boys
doesn't pass.

281
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:08,524
- I think that's fair.
- You're damn straight it is.

282
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:13,033
I'll enjoy watching you make
a complete ass of yourself.

283
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:19,203
It's gonna be a real pleasure
working with you again.

284
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:30,648
Romans...

285
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:34,152
...Chronicles. Chronicles. Ah, yes.

286
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:38,459
In the 40th year,
Amariah begat Zadok...

287
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:40,391
...who begat Libni...

288
00:23:40,597 --> 00:23:42,531
...the brother of Uzziah.

289
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,159
No, that's not it, either.

290
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:46,733
Just...

291
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:48,627
No...

292
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:14,528
Once upon a time, four of the best
pilots in the U.S. Air Force...

293
00:24:14,732 --> 00:24:17,166
...trained to fly into space.

294
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:22,570
They flew at the speed of sound
to the very top of the sky...

295
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,042
...cheating death and free-falling
from 20 miles high.

296
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:37,086
Nice to see you, young man.

297
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:38,777
- And you, sir.
- Reverend.

298
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:41,924
It's nice to have
you young people here.

299
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,218
Hey, boss.

300
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:47,362
Excuse me, my former boss.

301
00:24:47,564 --> 00:24:52,092
I bring glad tidings, Reverend Tank,
in the name of Team Daedalus.

302
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:55,169
It seems there might be
resurrection after all.

303
00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:57,636
Come in and let's talk about it.

304
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:05,003
I don't know, Frank.
That's a very complicated proposition.

305
00:25:05,215 --> 00:25:09,311
- I have a flock and grandchildren.
- They'll be here when you get back.

306
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:12,621
This'll give you material
for three or four more sermons.

307
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,253
- I'll need to pray about this.
- Could it be a quick prayer?

308
00:25:16,593 --> 00:25:19,926
Just wait a moment,
my stiff-necked brother.

309
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:24,129
I'm receiving a word from on high.

310
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,502
And what is that word?

311
00:25:27,137 --> 00:25:30,664
The word is, why the hell not?

312
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:34,166
There you go.

313
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,445
Good.

314
00:25:46,256 --> 00:25:48,451
Second one's too fast.

315
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,753
Some little Johnny
will pass out on us there.

316
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:09,544
35 years of designing
supersonic aircraft for the military.

317
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,375
Now he's building roller coasters.
That's perfect.

318
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:18,021
- Your father's a gifted man.
- He's gifted, all right.

319
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:30,866
Too flat.

320
00:26:31,602 --> 00:26:34,127
Oh, boy. We have some work to do.

321
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:40,299
Hey, sweetheart.

322
00:26:44,214 --> 00:26:46,375
- You did good.
- They didn't do what I--

323
00:26:48,218 --> 00:26:49,685
Hey, Frank.

324
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,055
Holy cow. What are you doing here?

325
00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:57,060
Finding out what you're doing
for the next month and a half.

326
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:00,727
NASA wants to send us into space.

327
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:05,258
I wondered which one of us
was gonna go first.

328
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:06,868
Senile dementia.

329
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,404
40-year-old memories are sharp
but you can't remember your breakfast.

330
00:27:11,808 --> 00:27:14,800
Frank Corvin, my associate, Cherie.

331
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:16,604
- Cherie.
- Hi.

332
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:18,371
What'd you have for breakfast?

333
00:27:19,216 --> 00:27:22,674
I had vegetarian huevos rancheros,
egg whites only, of course...

334
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:25,821
...and then some sort of
a filtered decaf cappuccino...

335
00:27:26,023 --> 00:27:28,491
...that was filtered
through a jockstrap.

336
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:32,285
- What are you talking about? NASA--
- Right here.

337
00:27:32,496 --> 00:27:34,862
Right here. Here's our contract.

338
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:42,972
You don't need those, do you?

339
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:48,137
No. Just to read. And go to movies,
drive, walk. You know.

340
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:50,708
- Holy cow. How on earth--
- Are you in?

341
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:53,073
Am I in? Hell, yeah.

342
00:27:53,283 --> 00:27:56,275
I can't believe it. Team Daedalus.
We ride again.

343
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,954
Hawk must've gone into orbit
when you told him.

344
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,020
I haven't talked to Hawk yet.

345
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:05,127
I haven't talked to Hawk
in a long time, Jerry.

346
00:28:06,096 --> 00:28:11,033
When are the two of you gonna grow up
and stop acting like little boys?

347
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:21,307
It's my birthday and I want
the shit scared out of me.

348
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:26,005
I wanna do barrel rolls and loop the
loops. All that kind of stuff.

349
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,186
We don't do that kind of flying.
It's dangerous and irresponsible.

350
00:28:30,387 --> 00:28:33,015
- Yeah, too many lawsuits.
- Well, who does?

351
00:28:33,323 --> 00:28:34,483
He does.

352
00:28:42,466 --> 00:28:43,433
Sweet.

353
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,832
Hey, Hawk.

354
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:56,408
- This guy wants a scary ride.
- It's my birthday.

355
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:00,649
Happy birthday.

356
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:08,956
Oh, we're upside-down! Oh, yeah!

357
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:22,469
Here comes the fun part.
We're going weightless.

358
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:25,737
I don't think that
that's such a good idea!

359
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:34,684
You're crazy!

360
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,890
I'm so sorry.

361
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:19,892
Where'd you get the bright idea
to eat a big lunch...

362
00:30:20,097 --> 00:30:22,531
...before you come out here
and went flying?

363
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,530
- I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.
- That's all right. I'll get it.

364
00:30:30,073 --> 00:30:31,870
Congratulations!

365
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:35,636
You earned your wings today,
young man. My hat's off to you!

366
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:38,474
Well done! Yes, sir.

367
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:40,212
- Splendid work.
- Thank you.

368
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:41,714
I surrender to you.

369
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:54,061
- I love you and being on the ground.
- What's that smell?

370
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,999
You know what the worst day
of my life was?

371
00:31:06,676 --> 00:31:08,940
The day Armstrong
set foot on the moon.

372
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:12,309
I was the only one that wanted
to commit suicide that day.

373
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:14,984
Thanks. We haven't talked
in 12 years...

374
00:31:15,185 --> 00:31:17,745
...and that's been
the big question on my mind:

375
00:31:17,954 --> 00:31:20,081
What could make you commit suicide?

376
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,858
What are you doing here?

377
00:31:23,627 --> 00:31:26,027
Filling a promise I made 40 years ago.

378
00:31:26,696 --> 00:31:28,561
Was that the promise to kill me...

379
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:31,199
...or the one
to have both of my legs broke?

380
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:33,335
It was the other one.

381
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:36,765
I'm working on a little blackmail
with NASA.

382
00:31:36,973 --> 00:31:39,806
They've got a satellite that'll crash
unless we fix it.

383
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,638
I'm guessing you designed
that guidance system.

384
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:46,247
Yeah. They're desperate.
Even Gerson's in on the deal.

385
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,476
I said I'd do it if the original
Team Daedalus did the job.

386
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:56,856
Here it is, all in black and white.

387
00:31:57,627 --> 00:32:01,324
Jerry and Tank are in and waiting
for us across the highway.

388
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:04,500
Old age just brings out
more of the Frank in you.

389
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:06,669
I'm genuinely impressed.

390
00:32:07,971 --> 00:32:11,771
But you don't need to put foolish
notions in the head of a fool.

391
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:14,770
Especially not a damned old fool.

392
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:16,544
You have a nice flight.

393
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:20,506
You weren't one then,
but you are one now.

394
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:22,776
Say hello to Barbara for me.

395
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:26,287
Yeah, you say hello to Jackie.

396
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,383
I wished I could.

397
00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:32,352
Jackie died on me, Frank.

398
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,361
Sorry. I didn't know that.

399
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:26,246
- He said no, huh?
- He's not coming.

400
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:28,007
Maybe we should talk to him.

401
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:31,379
He's the same stubborn jackass
he always was.

402
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:36,020
And you still drive slower than a
little old lady on her way to church.

403
00:34:05,322 --> 00:34:10,055
That is enough to send the astronaut
miles and miles in space.

404
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:14,161
So what if I was to jump
on a trampoline in space?

405
00:34:14,364 --> 00:34:17,299
You would go up and up and up...

406
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,060
...and you'd never come down!

407
00:34:21,304 --> 00:34:23,568
Could you hit a baseball to the moon?

408
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:26,742
Actually, you could.

409
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,171
You'd just have to knock it
halfway there.

410
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:31,973
That's just about 100,000 miles.

411
00:34:32,182 --> 00:34:34,980
And then the moon's gravity
does the rest.

412
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:37,249
- Okay? Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

413
00:34:37,754 --> 00:34:40,245
- You're welcome.
- Thank you, Mrs.Holland.

414
00:34:41,925 --> 00:34:45,417
I've never met a kid who didn't dream
of being an astronaut.

415
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,624
Ever meet a kid
that wouldn't grow up?

416
00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:53,769
Sara Holland this is William Hawkins,
retired Air Force colonel.

417
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:56,495
The best pilot they ever had,
next to me.

418
00:34:57,474 --> 00:34:59,567
The Hawk. I've heard of you.

419
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:03,405
Commander Jenkins told me a story
about you and him in Vietnam.

420
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:06,582
From Cliff Jenkins,
it's guaranteed to be 100% bullshit.

421
00:35:06,783 --> 00:35:09,513
I'll guarantee you that.
How's he doing?

422
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,587
Actually, he's dead.

423
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:17,690
While Hawk gets his foot out of his
mouth, I'll introduce Tank Sullivan.

424
00:35:17,894 --> 00:35:20,829
He's a navigator.
The best one the Air Force ever had.

425
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:24,057
He'd find anything anywhere.
That is, till God found him.

426
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:27,031
Now more than ever.
A pleasure to meet you.

427
00:35:27,237 --> 00:35:30,468
This is Jerry O'Neill. He's
a structural engineer and designer.

428
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:33,768
Jerry worked on the Stealth project.
You remember that.

429
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,477
No nickname for you?

430
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,340
Well, you can call me...

431
00:35:37,747 --> 00:35:38,714
...anytime.

432
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:42,273
Okay.

433
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:46,683
If you men are ready,
we have some work to do.

434
00:35:47,457 --> 00:35:50,255
Would you like a banana, honey?

435
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:58,028
I don't need to remind you of
the consequences of failure here.

436
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:02,102
- Personal consequences.
- That's the problem with you Russians.

437
00:36:02,305 --> 00:36:05,103
With you,
the glass is always half empty.

438
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:13,138
These men you are sending up,
they're not astronauts.

439
00:36:14,684 --> 00:36:18,780
The last time they trained for a space
mission, cars had fins on them.

440
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,684
The truth is Frank Corvin's
not going anywhere.

441
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:26,453
His team's not gonna pass
the physical trials.

442
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:30,564
This is supposed to reassure me?

443
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:34,834
What will you do then?

444
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:40,202
My best young astronaut
is training alongside Corvin...

445
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,176
...gaining proficiency
in that antiquated guidance system.

446
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,781
Until he does, Frank Corvin's
gonna believe he's going up.

447
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:53,578
I don't know.

448
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,489
- We should consult--
- There will be no goddamn consulting.

449
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:03,428
No one, and I mean no one,
is to be in the loop...

450
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:05,300
...on our little problem.

451
00:37:06,436 --> 00:37:09,166
Do I make myself perfectly clear,
general?

452
00:37:14,711 --> 00:37:15,837
Good morning, all.

453
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:20,141
And welcome to STS-200 ops
overview briefing.

454
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:23,251
This is an unusual mission,
I think we'd all agree.

455
00:37:23,453 --> 00:37:26,286
We'll get started
on the particulars here in a moment.

456
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:30,687
First, let's welcome the astronauts
selected for this mission:

457
00:37:30,894 --> 00:37:34,022
The founding members
of Project Daedalus.

458
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:44,462
As you all know, these men
are the pioneers of this business.

459
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:47,199
They were around
when rockets were born.

460
00:37:47,544 --> 00:37:48,374
Welcome, gentlemen.

461
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:55,678
STS-200 was originally slated
to deliver a structural payload...

462
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:58,183
...to the International Space Station.

463
00:37:58,388 --> 00:38:02,654
Circumstances have forced us to push
back that mission and undertake...

464
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:04,656
...an emergency rescue operation.

465
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:08,261
The average staging time for
a mission is 12 months.

466
00:38:08,998 --> 00:38:12,092
We're doing this one in 30 days.

467
00:38:14,571 --> 00:38:16,402
In 1986...

468
00:38:16,606 --> 00:38:21,407
...the former Soviet Union launched
communications satellite Ikon.

469
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:24,102
- Ikon is a link...
- I'll tell you about it later.

470
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:26,680
...in Russia's
telecommunications chain.

471
00:38:26,983 --> 00:38:29,451
Her orbit is rapidly decaying.

472
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:33,144
She will reenter
the Earth's atmosphere in 30 days.

473
00:38:33,356 --> 00:38:36,257
Your mission
is to intercept and capture her...

474
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:38,552
...using the shuttle's grappling arm.

475
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:41,025
You will then have a 42-hour window...

476
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:44,223
...in which to repair
her guidance system.

477
00:38:44,434 --> 00:38:47,335
From there she'll be reconfigured
by Mission Control.

478
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,630
After that, you'll shoot
her back into geosync orbit...

479
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,105
...using the payload assist
module rockets.

480
00:38:57,714 --> 00:38:59,079
Any questions?

481
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:00,709
Question.

482
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:05,984
With all due respect to the guys,
why don't we just capture the bird...

483
00:39:06,189 --> 00:39:09,488
...bring it home with a crew
trained in satellite retrieval?

484
00:39:10,026 --> 00:39:11,687
It's too big, Gene.

485
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:14,424
Too big?

486
00:39:16,332 --> 00:39:17,424
For the space shuttle?

487
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,369
How did you guys get it up there
in the first place?

488
00:39:26,142 --> 00:39:29,543
There were modifications
post-deployment.

489
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,047
Listen up, people.

490
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,449
This system has to be fixed on-site.

491
00:39:36,653 --> 00:39:38,450
Frank is the only engineer...

492
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:41,681
...proficient in
such obsolete technology.

493
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:46,088
Given the short amount of time...

494
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,594
...he's the only engineer
to do the job.

495
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:54,994
So Frank Corvin's band of...

496
00:39:55,638 --> 00:39:58,368
...Leisure World aviators
are going into space.

497
00:39:58,574 --> 00:40:01,202
NASA agree to all this?
Did the Russians?

498
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:04,778
- Frank didn't give us a lot of choice.
- I figured that.

499
00:40:04,981 --> 00:40:08,473
You hate each other way too much
to have cooked this up together.

500
00:40:10,186 --> 00:40:11,380
Count me out.

501
00:40:11,888 --> 00:40:14,857
I think you guys
need to get a new flight director.

502
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:18,793
You know, one thing
is driving me nuts, though.

503
00:40:20,063 --> 00:40:24,830
How did a guidance system from Skylab
end up in a Russian bird?

504
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:30,495
I don't know, Gene, but apparently
I'm the man who can fix it.

505
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:35,644
Grow up, will you, Frank?
Can't you be a team player for once?

506
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:39,279
Why can't you assist my astronauts
as an engineer?

507
00:40:39,482 --> 00:40:44,044
If I wasn't 100% sure that my guys
could do as well as your astronauts...

508
00:40:44,253 --> 00:40:46,517
...I wouldn't go anywhere near it.

509
00:40:47,156 --> 00:40:49,090
Still the same old Frank, huh?

510
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:52,417
Well, that's the consensus
around here.

511
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:58,958
So you fellas made a deal?
Fine. Here's my deal.

512
00:40:59,535 --> 00:41:03,335
I am the flight director and
I can pull the plug on this one.

513
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:05,097
When it's over, it's over.

514
00:41:05,308 --> 00:41:07,970
I am not turning over
a new space shuttle...

515
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:12,247
...to rookies with a month's training.
You're taking two of my guys.

516
00:41:12,982 --> 00:41:17,885
Ethan, who's a brown-nosing snot
and Roger, who's a cocky little shit.

517
00:41:18,254 --> 00:41:20,586
But they're the two best astronauts.

518
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,691
They fly or the package
stays on the ground.

519
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:27,958
- Deal?
- Well, okay, Gene.

520
00:41:28,297 --> 00:41:30,424
And if I sense for one second...

521
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:33,898
...that your team isn't cutting it
physically or mentally...

522
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:37,095
...you're off,
and my original team flies.

523
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:40,641
So let's see if you still
got it to go.

524
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,102
Suck it up, Frank.

525
00:41:47,383 --> 00:41:51,444
- Gene's the same guy I remembered.
- Yeah, he's an asshole.

526
00:41:51,654 --> 00:41:53,315
- A prick.
- Some things never change.

527
00:41:54,123 --> 00:41:56,990
Now just cough when I say, okay?

528
00:41:57,427 --> 00:41:58,621
Cough.

529
00:41:58,928 --> 00:42:00,486
And again, please.

530
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:02,686
Morning, gentlemen.

531
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:07,291
I'm Dr.Caruthers.
I'll be assisting Dr.Michaelson here.

532
00:42:09,939 --> 00:42:11,065
Hi.

533
00:42:16,813 --> 00:42:18,781
Nothing to be ashamed of.

534
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:20,647
Easy for you to say.

535
00:42:20,883 --> 00:42:23,977
- Cover your eye and read the chart.
- Time me.

536
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,085
"E, F, L, E, P, T...

537
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:27,984
...P, L, E, P, F, L, F, L, E...

538
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:29,954
...P, T, P, L, F, E, T, E...

539
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,560
...L, O, P, Z, D, D, E,
F, P, O, T, E, C...

540
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:36,556
...F, L, E, P, T, P, L, E, P...

541
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:40,964
...F, L, F, L, E, P, T, P, L,
F, L, T, M, A, D...

542
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,137
...in U, S, A."

543
00:42:42,338 --> 00:42:46,399
Made in the USA.
That's one for the economy, I guess.

544
00:42:46,742 --> 00:42:48,175
You have 20/10 vision.

545
00:42:48,377 --> 00:42:51,505
- I'll be damned.
- And 14 seconds.

546
00:42:52,782 --> 00:42:55,842
All right. "E, F, L, E, P, T...

547
00:42:56,052 --> 00:42:57,986
...P, L, E, P, F, L, E...

548
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:03,124
...L, E, P, T, L, P, E, F,
E, T, Z, E, T...

549
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:07,196
...T."

550
00:43:07,396 --> 00:43:10,160
- 20/20.
- And five seconds slow.

551
00:43:10,466 --> 00:43:11,558
Good.

552
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:13,429
- Next.
- I'm next.

553
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,872
- Five seconds, my ass.
- I wish I could be your next.

554
00:43:18,474 --> 00:43:22,672
Get your fiance to take you to a
French brasserie and give you oysters.

555
00:43:22,879 --> 00:43:26,371
- If he won't, can I?
- Let's see how you do on your physical.

556
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:29,710
I'll just do the bottom three lines.
F, L, E, P, T, P...

557
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,479
...L, E, P, F, L, F,
L, E, P, T, P, L, F, E, T."

558
00:43:32,688 --> 00:43:35,885
Do you think oysters would be
too much for the first date?

559
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:41,029
- You have 20/10 vision, captain.
- These are just for looking at you.

560
00:43:42,932 --> 00:43:45,901
I may be blind, Frank,
but my memory's perfect.

561
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:52,769
Next.

562
00:43:53,643 --> 00:43:54,974
Colonel Hawkins.

563
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,769
You all right?

564
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:03,077
- I'm just not too crazy about needles.
- Well, that's pretty common.

565
00:44:04,754 --> 00:44:07,348
Make a fist
and pump it a couple times.

566
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:10,223
Okay, that's good.

567
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,453
- You don't remember me, do you?
- What?

568
00:44:13,663 --> 00:44:16,461
My father was flight surgeon
at Beale Air Force Base.

569
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:18,099
Oh, yeah.

570
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:22,361
- Dr.Martin. The Goat.
- The Goat, yeah. That was my dad.

571
00:44:22,572 --> 00:44:25,632
I met you when I was 12 years old.
I doubt you remember.

572
00:44:25,841 --> 00:44:27,536
Now wait a minute now.

573
00:44:27,743 --> 00:44:30,268
Pigtails, freckles
and knobby little knees.

574
00:44:30,479 --> 00:44:32,106
- Was that you?
- That was me.

575
00:44:33,649 --> 00:44:37,915
- How is old Goat?
- He passed away nine years ago.

576
00:44:42,658 --> 00:44:45,650
You noticed how everybody
seems to be dead lately?

577
00:44:45,861 --> 00:44:47,658
- Yeah.
- I hear that.

578
00:44:49,832 --> 00:44:51,800
You guys ready to do some laps?

579
00:44:52,535 --> 00:44:53,661
Sure.

580
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:56,702
- We'll go easy today. We'll do ten.
- Minutes?

581
00:44:56,906 --> 00:44:59,101
Miles. Let's go.

582
00:44:59,342 --> 00:45:00,673
Miles.

583
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:02,776
- Little prick.
- Frank.

584
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:05,646
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

585
00:45:05,848 --> 00:45:08,316
Did he really mean miles?

586
00:45:19,862 --> 00:45:22,558
- How far have we gone, Frank?
- Almost two.

587
00:45:22,765 --> 00:45:26,861
- I'm going to have a heart attack.
- That's the point.

588
00:45:27,069 --> 00:45:29,594
- What? To give us heart attacks?
- Hell, yes.

589
00:45:29,805 --> 00:45:31,705
Suppose we didn't make liftoff.

590
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:35,035
We'd be the first country
to launch dead bodies into orbit.

591
00:45:35,278 --> 00:45:36,939
If we have heart attacks...

592
00:45:37,146 --> 00:45:39,842
...NASA will want us
to have it right here on Earth.

593
00:45:40,049 --> 00:45:42,813
- Get moving.
- I'm an engineer, for crying out loud.

594
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:47,353
- I stopped running during Nixon.
- Your lady doctor's watching.

595
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:48,853
- She is?
- Oh, no.

596
00:46:01,504 --> 00:46:03,199
Do 225, colonel?

597
00:46:03,606 --> 00:46:07,337
Oh, hell, yes.
Hell, yes. Spot me, tiger.

598
00:46:07,543 --> 00:46:08,703
You got it.

599
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:13,204
- Ready? There we go.
- Yeah.

600
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:16,213
All right, let it go.
Let her go, Hawk.

601
00:46:16,419 --> 00:46:18,387
Come on, you can do it. Thattaboy.

602
00:46:18,587 --> 00:46:20,316
Thattaboy.

603
00:46:20,556 --> 00:46:25,118
All right. Push, baby.
Push, push. Up.

604
00:46:25,328 --> 00:46:27,819
All right, come on. Here we go.

605
00:46:28,397 --> 00:46:29,455
Let her go.

606
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:31,064
Let her go. Push it, baby.

607
00:46:31,901 --> 00:46:33,766
Come on. Yeah, you got it.

608
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:37,063
You the man. All right.
I got it. I got it.

609
00:46:37,573 --> 00:46:38,767
All right now!

610
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:41,442
- Thattaboy.
- Oh, yes, sir.

611
00:46:41,644 --> 00:46:43,077
Not bad.

612
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:47,907
You trying to do something
over there.

613
00:46:48,117 --> 00:46:50,585
Anything worth doing's
worth doing well.

614
00:46:52,254 --> 00:46:54,745
I'm going to go
to my room now and cry.

615
00:47:06,302 --> 00:47:08,429
I'm too tired to chew.

616
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:11,433
Try to look a little perkier,
will you, fellas?

617
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,442
You still want to go on with this,
Frank?

618
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:25,515
What do you want to do, quit now?
We just finished the tough stuff.

619
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:27,746
Now we start training for the mission.

620
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:32,451
- Everybody get a good night's sleep.
- There's a real challenge.

621
00:47:34,296 --> 00:47:35,593
What are you doing?

622
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:38,496
What are you doing?

623
00:47:39,568 --> 00:47:41,035
Goddamn...

624
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,629
...teeth won't stay in.

625
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:46,640
Damn, Jerry.

626
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:49,000
Jesus.

627
00:47:50,045 --> 00:47:53,947
Gentlemen, a round of drinks
from your friends over there...

628
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:58,109
...who ordered you some goodies.
A little Ensure for you guys.

629
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:06,125
To old gummers in space.

630
00:48:06,328 --> 00:48:07,352
Cheers.

631
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:12,232
I drink this stuff.

632
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:14,993
It's good for your libido.

633
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:23,140
- Race you the last lap.
- All right.

634
00:48:23,345 --> 00:48:25,472
- Okay. Countdown to one?
- All right.

635
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:26,841
One!

636
00:48:51,407 --> 00:48:54,865
Frank, hi. I was looking for Hawk.

637
00:48:55,744 --> 00:48:57,871
Well, come on in. Come on in.

638
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:02,141
He's right in there. Go ahead.
The coast is all clear.

639
00:49:02,351 --> 00:49:04,046
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

640
00:49:12,428 --> 00:49:14,191
I am so sorry.

641
00:49:14,463 --> 00:49:17,762
No, it's okay. It's okay.
It's all right.

642
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,236
What brings you to
the men's locker room?

643
00:49:23,439 --> 00:49:27,569
Gene moved up the stimulator, I mean,
I'm sorry, the simulator run.

644
00:49:28,143 --> 00:49:30,634
Okay. To when?

645
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:35,576
Oh, right. That would be...

646
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:37,683
...11:00.

647
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:42,119
There were some procedures
that I wanted you to be aware of.

648
00:49:44,593 --> 00:49:47,756
This is very uncomfortable,
and I'll be leaving now.

649
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:52,129
I'm going to take you out for a beer.

650
00:49:53,335 --> 00:49:55,132
I'll be needing one.

651
00:49:57,706 --> 00:49:57,740
[ Skipped item nr. 650 ]

652
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,605
Here we go.

653
00:50:00,009 --> 00:50:02,102
Right on target.

654
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:06,105
Hi. Jerry O'Neill.

655
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:10,310
Do you mind, lady?
You make me nervous.

656
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:14,353
Get used to it. You'll have a lot
more people watching you on TV.

657
00:50:14,557 --> 00:50:17,082
Thank you. Very comforting.

658
00:50:17,526 --> 00:50:20,393
- You don't make me nervous.
- Oh, Jerry.

659
00:50:22,798 --> 00:50:26,700
I got a roller coaster that'll stop
your heart. I threw up on my helmet!

660
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:30,269
That was three Gs. As bad as it gets
during ascent and reentry.

661
00:50:30,472 --> 00:50:33,669
I am so pleased.
It was a piece of cake, guys.

662
00:50:33,876 --> 00:50:35,901
Okay, thanks.

663
00:50:46,488 --> 00:50:49,821
- First one to pass out buys the beer.
- You're on.

664
00:51:00,703 --> 00:51:02,227
This thing moving?

665
00:51:03,572 --> 00:51:06,234
I don't know.
Doesn't seem to be moving to me.

666
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:12,706
Say, fellas, is y'all's
equipment broke down?

667
00:51:20,356 --> 00:51:21,618
What's going on?

668
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,301
Makes them look younger, doesn't it?

669
00:51:33,502 --> 00:51:37,598
- You're a pushover.
- I do believe it's moving now.

670
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:46,113
That sure will take the wrinkles out.

671
00:51:49,952 --> 00:51:51,613
What the hell's going on here!?

672
00:51:55,924 --> 00:52:00,725
I'm sure you think you're putting on
a great show, but this is not a toy!

673
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:06,725
Now which one of you idiots
wants to explain this?

674
00:52:07,403 --> 00:52:08,233
Gene.

675
00:52:09,571 --> 00:52:10,560
What?

676
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,840
Which one of us passed out first?

677
00:52:17,413 --> 00:52:19,779
I'm getting too old for this shit.

678
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:48,508
I can cook things you wouldn't
believe. I cook crab, lobster.

679
00:53:02,124 --> 00:53:04,115
That'll be seven dollars.

680
00:53:04,727 --> 00:53:06,217
Hello?

681
00:53:09,331 --> 00:53:11,458
I'm sorry. He's buying.

682
00:53:11,867 --> 00:53:14,631
- We both passed out at the same time.
- Bullshit.

683
00:53:14,837 --> 00:53:18,329
I saw you pass out just before
I passed out. I saw that.

684
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:22,169
But never mind. I'll get this round
because of my confidence.

685
00:53:22,377 --> 00:53:26,245
Absolute confidence in my superiority,
absolute superiority to you...

686
00:53:26,448 --> 00:53:29,474
...in every human endeavor in life.
Keep the change.

687
00:53:29,685 --> 00:53:32,017
We'll leave it up to the young lady.

688
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:35,782
Tell me, given the circumstances
which one of us...

689
00:53:35,991 --> 00:53:39,358
- ...would you take home tonight?
- You mean, like, to the home?

690
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:42,587
- Yeah.
- Like, the retirement home?

691
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:44,823
Seriously.
Would you choose this man...

692
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:48,025
...with his asymmetrical
sagging ass cheeks...

693
00:53:48,237 --> 00:53:50,467
...love handles
the size of Nebraska...

694
00:53:50,672 --> 00:53:53,505
...and his gross, old,
ugly ingrown toenails?

695
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:57,167
Or this hairy-eared son of a bitch
with a chicken gizzard neck...

696
00:53:57,379 --> 00:54:00,177
...and a face like
Death Valley fire trails?

697
00:54:00,382 --> 00:54:04,045
- Stop harassing the waitress.
- I'm not. What are you talking about?

698
00:54:04,253 --> 00:54:07,518
I'm having a private conversation
that doesn't involve you.

699
00:54:07,723 --> 00:54:11,625
Go back to your virgin pink daiquiri
and mind your own business.

700
00:54:11,827 --> 00:54:14,990
She's my friend who has to put up
with assholes like you.

701
00:54:15,197 --> 00:54:16,630
- Tiny--
- But I don't.

702
00:54:16,832 --> 00:54:18,595
If you want to harass, harass me.

703
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:23,070
- I believe he's harassing you already.
- I'll put you in the hospital.

704
00:54:23,272 --> 00:54:25,570
I have Medicare.
Shoot your best shot.

705
00:54:25,774 --> 00:54:28,334
- I'll make your old lady a widow.
- Don't--

706
00:54:28,544 --> 00:54:32,742
Wait! You can't do this! No,
you're going up into space in 22 days.

707
00:54:32,948 --> 00:54:35,508
If you break a bone
or sprain your ankle...

708
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:39,517
...your space shuttle seat'll go to
that MIT weenie with blow-dried hair.

709
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:42,383
We'll watch the launch on TV
at your damn house.

710
00:54:42,591 --> 00:54:46,288
- What makes you think I'll hurt myself?
- What about a space shuttle?

711
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:50,226
You're gonna blow this for us again.
You and your mean-ass temper.

712
00:54:50,432 --> 00:54:54,664
- Are you saying I blew it back in '58?
- Hell, yes, you blew it in '58.

713
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:57,566
You crashed every plane
the Air Force gave us.

714
00:54:57,773 --> 00:54:59,798
All right. We're taking this outside.

715
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:03,239
I'll whip your ass!
Get out there in that parking lot!

716
00:55:04,446 --> 00:55:06,004
You wait here, Tiny.

717
00:55:06,548 --> 00:55:09,949
- Let's go.
- I got ten on Frank.

718
00:55:16,325 --> 00:55:18,452
Can I get your ass
out of a jam or not?

719
00:55:18,694 --> 00:55:21,390
Did you see that guy's face
when I said--

720
00:55:23,098 --> 00:55:26,761
Just who got Team Daedalus canned,
Colonel Hawkins?

721
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:29,267
Damn, this is gonna be a long night.

722
00:55:36,845 --> 00:55:40,303
Hawk's pretty quick.
Frank's got the reach, however.

723
00:55:40,582 --> 00:55:44,211
That girl I was dancing with
was a database administrator.

724
00:55:44,419 --> 00:55:45,613
Really?

725
00:55:46,955 --> 00:55:48,183
Morning, partner.

726
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:50,752
- Morning, Hawk.
- Good morning.

727
00:55:50,959 --> 00:55:53,621
- What happened to your eye?
- I fell in the shower.

728
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:58,630
Tell maintenance to put some no-slip
adhesives on that slippery floor.

729
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:04,896
How's that right there?

730
00:56:06,842 --> 00:56:09,970
Still ten megahertz,
maybe a little more.

731
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,740
How's it going, Frank?

732
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:16,046
Fine. Fine.

733
00:56:17,819 --> 00:56:18,911
What's with the eye?

734
00:56:20,155 --> 00:56:21,349
Slip in the shower?

735
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:24,354
How would you know that?

736
00:56:26,328 --> 00:56:27,955
I'll chat with the janitor.

737
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:38,031
Airspeed, 300.

738
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:40,974
Crosswind on our right, 14 knots.

739
00:56:43,178 --> 00:56:46,011
Running a little hot.
Want to open up a speed brake?

740
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,481
200.

741
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,882
100.

742
00:56:55,557 --> 00:56:57,024
Touchdown.

743
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:02,028
Nice landing, guys.

744
00:57:02,264 --> 00:57:05,165
Let's put the rookies up front.
Simsupe, you on with me?

745
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:06,732
Simsupe. Go, Gene.

746
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:09,529
- It's gonna be tough to beat.
- I think so.

747
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:12,570
You up.

748
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:15,403
Standard package.

749
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,579
Let's throw them a Little League
kind of curve.

750
00:57:19,348 --> 00:57:21,748
Hydraulic failure.
Switching to secondary.

751
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,383
I'm going to manual control.

752
00:57:23,585 --> 00:57:26,884
You can't do that, colonel.
The bird's on a computerized track.

753
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,920
1000 feet. Your airspeed's too high.
Stick to their protocol, will you?

754
00:57:33,128 --> 00:57:35,392
I'm going to manual control.
Goddamn, boy.

755
00:57:35,597 --> 00:57:37,565
You cannot do that!

756
00:57:37,866 --> 00:57:39,834
Secondary hydraulic failure.

757
00:57:40,035 --> 00:57:42,162
- You'll come in short.
- Like hell.

758
00:57:48,443 --> 00:57:49,603
Shit.

759
00:57:51,146 --> 00:57:54,081
Come on. You can't throw that
at them on the first run.

760
00:57:54,282 --> 00:57:57,342
We got three weeks to send
four old farts into space.

761
00:57:57,552 --> 00:57:59,918
This is flight school 101 stuff.

762
00:58:01,423 --> 00:58:06,258
Look, this is not a stripped-down show
plane. You gotta do it their way.

763
00:58:06,495 --> 00:58:09,521
I don't need a computer
to tell me how to land a plane.

764
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:12,256
It's not a plane.
It's a flying brick on approach.

765
00:58:12,467 --> 00:58:15,664
- You got to use the on-board computer.
- What if it fails?

766
00:58:16,204 --> 00:58:17,569
It's never failed.

767
00:58:18,507 --> 00:58:19,565
Houston, Horizon.

768
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:21,273
Go, Horizon.

769
00:58:21,843 --> 00:58:25,370
Request secondary landing, please.
Houston, Horizon.

770
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,413
Request on-board computer failure...

771
00:58:28,617 --> 00:58:30,812
...on second landing.

772
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,919
All right, run it again.

773
00:58:33,622 --> 00:58:36,853
- Horizon, stand by for 2nd approach.
- Sock it to them.

774
00:58:37,793 --> 00:58:39,556
3000 feet. Coming in too steep.

775
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:42,397
Pull up, sir. You'll lose it again.

776
00:58:42,597 --> 00:58:45,122
Fire in Av Bay Two.
You'll lose avionics.

777
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:49,663
I don't need them anyway, this thing's
a flying brick on approach.

778
00:58:50,338 --> 00:58:53,068
Wind shear off the nose
and the fire is contained.

779
00:58:53,275 --> 00:58:55,243
Computers are down. She's all yours.

780
00:58:55,444 --> 00:58:57,378
500 feet. You're almost lined up.

781
00:58:57,746 --> 00:58:59,680
Your airspeed is way too high.

782
00:58:59,881 --> 00:59:03,146
Airspeed is four-niner-zero.
Coming in too high.

783
00:59:03,351 --> 00:59:05,819
- You'll overshoot.
- You won't get it stopped.

784
00:59:06,021 --> 00:59:09,752
It's easy. All you got to do is
tap on the brakes a little bit.

785
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:18,998
Not that much.
You'll put her into a stall.

786
00:59:21,169 --> 00:59:23,535
100 feet.
You know what you're doing, right?

787
00:59:23,738 --> 00:59:27,196
- I'm tapping on the brakes a bit.
- Drop the nose! You'll lose it.

788
00:59:27,409 --> 00:59:28,433
Knock it off!

789
00:59:28,643 --> 00:59:29,735
Drop the nose.

790
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:32,709
- What's the airspeed?
- 200. You're right on it.

791
00:59:32,914 --> 00:59:36,873
What do you say we just
drop that nose a little bit...

792
00:59:37,085 --> 00:59:38,552
...like that right there.

793
00:59:43,992 --> 00:59:45,926
Smooth as a baby's ass.

794
00:59:47,696 --> 00:59:49,095
That's impossible.

795
00:59:49,564 --> 00:59:51,862
For a computer it might be.

796
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:54,568
Flying brick.

797
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:55,959
I like that.

798
01:00:04,279 --> 01:00:08,716
Ladies and gentlemen, from your
teammates at the table over there.

799
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:11,445
Gerber's baby food.

800
01:00:11,653 --> 01:00:14,986
And some training material
for you to look over.

801
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,420
Pictures for the bigger words.

802
01:00:20,362 --> 01:00:22,091
A talking frog's worth something.

803
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,268
- 40 percent.
- 40 percent?!

804
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:30,802
You might nail it.
You might crash and burn.

805
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:33,804
- The odds are against you, colonel.
- Watch this.

806
01:00:37,979 --> 01:00:39,139
40 percent.

807
01:00:39,347 --> 01:00:41,679
40 percent for you, you nail it.

808
01:00:41,883 --> 01:00:44,545
40 percent for me,
I'd have missed by a mile.

809
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:47,347
That's why I got out of
the astronaut program.

810
01:00:47,722 --> 01:00:51,988
I knew my chances of getting on
a space shuttle were way less than 40.

811
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:54,788
But I was an astronaut, almost.

812
01:00:54,996 --> 01:00:58,295
- You'd have been a damn good one too.
- Thank you.

813
01:00:59,768 --> 01:01:04,137
You don't think like that. You've
jumped out of planes 20 miles up.

814
01:01:04,339 --> 01:01:07,365
You drove rocket sleds
at the speed of sound.

815
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:11,407
- You're not afraid of anything.
- I've been afraid.

816
01:01:11,613 --> 01:01:13,979
Oh, bullshit. When?

817
01:01:17,252 --> 01:01:19,413
When I was 17 years old.

818
01:01:21,823 --> 01:01:25,259
I was crazy in love
with this college girl.

819
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,558
She was beautiful. Oh, gorgeous.

820
01:01:28,763 --> 01:01:30,458
And a ball of fire.

821
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:32,893
She, of course,
was crazy in love with--

822
01:01:33,101 --> 01:01:34,398
- You.
- No.

823
01:01:34,603 --> 01:01:37,265
Texas A&M's all-American defensive end
Scott LeBeau.

824
01:01:37,472 --> 01:01:41,169
And I mean, this cat
was six-foot-six if he was a foot.

825
01:01:42,043 --> 01:01:43,874
Gary Cooper handsome.

826
01:01:44,946 --> 01:01:48,973
One day, a bunch of friends and I
decided we'd drink too much beer...

827
01:01:49,184 --> 01:01:51,948
...and crash a big old
sorority cotillion.

828
01:01:52,153 --> 01:01:56,249
You know, everybody's dressed up
in chiffon gowns and Daddy's tuxedo.

829
01:01:56,458 --> 01:02:01,020
There we are, looking like a bunch
of brush poppers and goat ropers.

830
01:02:01,296 --> 01:02:05,960
- At the governor's ranch too.
- I'm beginning to get the picture.

831
01:02:06,167 --> 01:02:10,604
So my friends tell me that they see
LeBeau entering the Port-a-Potty.

832
01:02:10,805 --> 01:02:13,399
One of them little old
fiberglass shithouses.

833
01:02:13,608 --> 01:02:16,441
I did a better tackle on that
fiberglass shithouse...

834
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:19,273
...than he ever did
on the football field...

835
01:02:19,481 --> 01:02:22,075
...and the thing rolled
down a bluff into a creek.

836
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:25,151
Screaming and yelling
all the way down...

837
01:02:25,353 --> 01:02:28,811
...except it don't sound like no
all-American defensive end.

838
01:02:29,024 --> 01:02:33,961
- It's decidedly more feminine.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

839
01:02:34,162 --> 01:02:38,496
The love of my life, rolling down
the bluff in a fiberglass shithouse.

840
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,100
It was very, very sad.

841
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,834
- What happened then?
- I ran like hell.

842
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,737
- Joined the Air Force the next day.
- Afraid LeBeau'd kick your ass.

843
01:02:48,943 --> 01:02:51,537
Well, hell, no.
I wasn't afraid of him.

844
01:02:51,746 --> 01:02:54,078
I was afraid, I mean...

845
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,741
...truly afraid of her.

846
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,983
Are you afraid of me?

847
01:03:11,433 --> 01:03:13,025
I married her.

848
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,894
Four years later.

849
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:45,058
What? I'm only 15 minutes late.

850
01:03:53,241 --> 01:03:54,538
Oh, shit.

851
01:03:58,513 --> 01:04:01,311
Extra, extra. Read all about it.

852
01:04:01,516 --> 01:04:03,882
I don't know how this leaked out.
I swear.

853
01:04:04,085 --> 01:04:07,919
NASA's been getting calls from
every tabloid in the country...

854
01:04:08,123 --> 01:04:10,318
...asking me to verify that story.

855
01:04:11,259 --> 01:04:13,227
Why can't we verify the story?

856
01:04:13,828 --> 01:04:15,557
- Why?
- Yeah.

857
01:04:15,764 --> 01:04:19,291
Because STS-200 is a delicate,
top-secret satellite recovery...

858
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:21,025
...that's why.

859
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:23,965
That makes it look like
a goddamn three-ring circus.

860
01:04:24,439 --> 01:04:27,431
How do you think the vice president
felt this morning...

861
01:04:27,642 --> 01:04:29,940
...when he opened his paper
and saw that?

862
01:04:31,312 --> 01:04:34,873
It's easy for you to laugh.
You don't deal with him. I do.

863
01:04:41,289 --> 01:04:44,383
We're going to simulate your
onboard living conditions...

864
01:04:44,592 --> 01:04:47,857
...to familiarize you with
the new living environment.

865
01:04:55,303 --> 01:04:56,668
Watch your step.

866
01:04:57,071 --> 01:04:59,096
- What the hell's this thing?
- ACM.

867
01:05:00,241 --> 01:05:04,701
- Asshole Centering Monitor.
- Gentlemen, this is your funnel.

868
01:05:04,913 --> 01:05:07,677
It attaches to the hose here.

869
01:05:07,882 --> 01:05:12,046
Before starting, make sure you have
a tight seal against your skin.

870
01:05:12,353 --> 01:05:15,618
- Is that the only one you got?
- Yes, one size does fit all.

871
01:05:15,824 --> 01:05:19,988
But just in case, there's a diaper
underneath your pressurized suits.

872
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:23,130
- I'll use that.
- I'm sure you will.

873
01:05:25,099 --> 01:05:26,430
Anything else?

874
01:05:38,012 --> 01:05:40,003
You're having a bit of an acid thing.

875
01:05:40,215 --> 01:05:41,842
- No, no, no.
- It's a flashback.

876
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:43,881
No, no. Seriously.

877
01:05:44,886 --> 01:05:49,823
Avionics on this thing, some of them
are quite old. B-52-type stuff.

878
01:05:51,826 --> 01:05:56,388
My next guests are the most famous men
in America. There they are on People.

879
01:05:56,598 --> 01:05:58,862
USA Today calls them
"The Ripe Stuff."

880
01:05:59,067 --> 01:06:01,592
Please welcome Team Daedalus.

881
01:06:07,108 --> 01:06:08,439
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

882
01:06:08,643 --> 01:06:10,270
Have a seat, guys.

883
01:06:17,952 --> 01:06:19,510
Thank you, gentlemen.

884
01:06:21,189 --> 01:06:24,955
It's an honor to meet you all.
This is a very exciting story.

885
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:27,491
You all come from varied backgrounds.

886
01:06:27,695 --> 01:06:31,461
One of you is a Baptist minister.

887
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:35,225
Is that Tank? Can I call you Tank?
Tank Sullivan.

888
01:06:35,436 --> 01:06:37,301
You may call me Tank.

889
01:06:37,705 --> 01:06:40,435
What is that?
That's a cross with a rocket on it.

890
01:06:40,642 --> 01:06:43,236
What faith is that?
I'm not familiar with it.

891
01:06:43,444 --> 01:06:44,468
- It's mine.
- Lutheran?

892
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:47,204
- What is it? What is it?
- It's Baptist.

893
01:06:47,415 --> 01:06:50,748
Which guy is the babe magnet?
That would be Jerry.

894
01:06:50,952 --> 01:06:52,749
- That's Jerry.
- Are you?

895
01:06:52,954 --> 01:06:55,980
I keep telling these guys
it's got nothing to do with me.

896
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:58,283
It depends entirely on the woman...

897
01:06:58,493 --> 01:07:03,430
...and how willing she is to discover
her infinite supply of orgasms.

898
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:05,064
- Really?
- Yeah, it's true.

899
01:07:09,237 --> 01:07:11,637
- It's the truth.
- You know, I think...

900
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:16,173
... women watching are going, "No
matter their age, men never change."

901
01:07:20,348 --> 01:07:24,114
- You all have a military background?
- That's true. That's true.

902
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:27,015
North or South? Which side?
I'm teasing.

903
01:07:27,221 --> 01:07:28,745
- You see-- I'm sorry.
- Low.

904
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:31,425
I know, I know. You can't help it.

905
01:07:43,471 --> 01:07:44,768
What did he do?

906
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,555
So the relay patch is the key?

907
01:08:08,229 --> 01:08:09,958
Plain as the nose on your face.

908
01:08:10,498 --> 01:08:14,730
- How'd you bypass the heat exchanger?
- I didn't bypass anything.

909
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:18,596
You're not being very forthcoming
on the guidance system.

910
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,206
Kid, I've done everything
short of...

911
01:08:21,409 --> 01:08:24,242
...calculus instructions to bring you
up to speed.

912
01:08:24,445 --> 01:08:27,414
What do you want, a picture?
Connect the dots?

913
01:08:28,049 --> 01:08:31,644
Excuse me. I hold two master's
degrees from MIT, Dr.Corvin.

914
01:08:31,853 --> 01:08:33,912
Maybe you ought to
get your money back.

915
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:37,649
You were just brought up on
a different set of technologies.

916
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:42,023
You're compromising this mission. I'm
your backup on a need-to-know basis.

917
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:45,160
You don't need to know dick.
I don't need a backup.

918
01:08:45,366 --> 01:08:46,560
Yes, you do.

919
01:08:46,768 --> 01:08:48,065
More than you know.

920
01:08:49,037 --> 01:08:50,470
What's that supposed to mean?

921
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:55,031
What don't I know?

922
01:08:55,943 --> 01:08:57,570
What don't I know?

923
01:09:00,281 --> 01:09:03,444
You son of a bitch.
You're setting me up again.

924
01:09:04,018 --> 01:09:08,352
Here's one of our astronauts now.
What a semi-pleasant surprise.

925
01:09:08,556 --> 01:09:12,549
- You had no intention of sending me up.
- I'm in the middle of something now.

926
01:09:14,362 --> 01:09:15,954
Well, now, that's great.

927
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:19,688
You hung up on the head of
our program: the U.S. vice president.

928
01:09:19,901 --> 01:09:23,393
- What can I do for you?
- You had no intention of sending me up.

929
01:09:23,604 --> 01:09:26,869
You screwed me over in 1958
and you're screwing me over now!

930
01:09:27,308 --> 01:09:28,775
I screwed you over?

931
01:09:28,976 --> 01:09:32,571
What did I do, make a deal with you
anyway? A chronic liar!

932
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:37,208
What deal? I didn't make any deal
with you. You blackmailed me.

933
01:09:37,418 --> 01:09:42,014
If you want to stick by your
so-called deal, then you lost.

934
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:44,153
I don't have to send you up.

935
01:09:46,861 --> 01:09:47,953
What is all this?

936
01:09:48,162 --> 01:09:51,598
It means someone on your team
didn't pass his physical.

937
01:09:51,799 --> 01:09:53,460
One of you has cancer.

938
01:09:56,604 --> 01:09:58,003
It's in his pancreas.

939
01:10:05,346 --> 01:10:07,109
And it's inoperable.

940
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:11,111
Does he know about it?

941
01:10:11,652 --> 01:10:13,950
Dr.Caruthers talked to him
this morning.

942
01:10:16,357 --> 01:10:18,120
Jesus.

943
01:10:20,194 --> 01:10:21,684
No.

944
01:10:21,896 --> 01:10:25,457
No. We're going to get another
doctor and get another opinion.

945
01:10:25,666 --> 01:10:29,602
Not one that's on your payroll.
This is even low by your standards.

946
01:10:29,804 --> 01:10:32,102
You'll do anything
to keep me from going up.

947
01:10:32,707 --> 01:10:34,072
Oh, really?

948
01:10:34,842 --> 01:10:37,003
So that's what this drama's all about.

949
01:10:37,211 --> 01:10:40,476
This whole time I thought
it was about your friend Hawk!

950
01:10:40,681 --> 01:10:43,809
But it's really about your seat
on the space shuttle.

951
01:10:44,485 --> 01:10:48,649
You can just back off, because NASA
will send you up in the space shuttle.

952
01:10:48,856 --> 01:10:51,791
You, Jerry and Tank, regardless
of whatever deal you had with me!

953
01:10:53,898 --> 01:10:58,232
- I don't understand.
- Come on. You're front-page news now.

954
01:10:58,435 --> 01:11:03,168
A genuine all-American hero. You've
made NASA popular all over again.

955
01:11:03,374 --> 01:11:06,366
Thanks to you, they'll get
their juicy budget infusion...

956
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:08,408
...they've been drooling over.

957
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:12,878
You're going up, all right.
The vice president insists.

958
01:11:15,553 --> 01:11:18,681
I have to call the head
of the space program back.

959
01:11:18,889 --> 01:11:21,687
You've got a lot of work to do
before we leave.

960
01:11:27,731 --> 01:11:29,255
And you shut the door!

961
01:11:39,443 --> 01:11:41,035
This is my Blackbird.

962
01:11:42,446 --> 01:11:45,415
I retired this very airplane in 1990.

963
01:11:46,183 --> 01:11:47,411
And now...

964
01:11:47,818 --> 01:11:48,910
...here we sit.

965
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:51,246
I've never actually seen one before.

966
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:53,923
SR-71. This is what
a plane's supposed to be.

967
01:11:54,124 --> 01:11:58,993
This is ugly on the ground, leaks like
a sieve, but up around Mach one...

968
01:11:59,196 --> 01:12:04,099
...the seals all expand, she dries up,
flies like a bat out of hell.

969
01:12:05,769 --> 01:12:07,430
I took her right to the limit.

970
01:12:08,372 --> 01:12:10,602
128,000 feet.

971
01:12:12,509 --> 01:12:14,602
She's only happy...

972
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:17,172
...going fast. It's not meant to sit.

973
01:12:17,381 --> 01:12:20,817
That's a lousy way to die,
just sitting around waiting...

974
01:12:23,654 --> 01:12:26,623
- Is eight months the best I can do?
- They don't know.

975
01:12:26,824 --> 01:12:30,191
- There's chemo, radiation.
- Shit.

976
01:12:31,095 --> 01:12:33,962
I watched my wife go out that way.
I ain't doing it.

977
01:12:34,665 --> 01:12:36,394
The love of your life.

978
01:12:39,536 --> 01:12:41,800
What is a pancreas anyhow?

979
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,471
I mean, I don't know what
the damn thing does for you...

980
01:12:47,544 --> 01:12:49,409
...besides give you cancer.

981
01:12:52,616 --> 01:12:55,176
What kind of odds would
you have give you and me?

982
01:12:55,986 --> 01:12:57,681
Better than 40.

983
01:13:22,913 --> 01:13:25,143
I know how much this flight
meant to you.

984
01:13:25,349 --> 01:13:28,079
Looks like I crashed another one.
I'm sorry.

985
01:13:28,752 --> 01:13:31,220
They want to take Jerry
and Tank and me.

986
01:13:31,422 --> 01:13:35,916
That's great. You played them
fellas just right. That's good.

987
01:13:36,126 --> 01:13:39,926
- You said yes, didn't you?
- I didn't say anything.

988
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:43,531
You don't want to blow it again.
This is your last shot.

989
01:13:44,101 --> 01:13:45,295
This isn't easy.

990
01:13:45,502 --> 01:13:48,528
Easy, hell.
Don't whine to me about easy.

991
01:13:48,739 --> 01:13:50,331
Put yourself in my shoes.

992
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:53,135
You've been blaming me for 40 years.

993
01:13:53,344 --> 01:13:56,939
You're not laying this on me.
You choke this one, it's on you.

994
01:13:57,147 --> 01:13:59,513
- All on you.
- What would you do?

995
01:13:59,717 --> 01:14:01,708
I'd leave your ass on the ground.

996
01:14:01,919 --> 01:14:03,250
I'll bet you would.

997
01:14:03,454 --> 01:14:05,513
To go into space? You bet your ass.

998
01:14:08,192 --> 01:14:09,625
In a heartbeat.

999
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:15,189
Know what the worst day
in my life was?

1000
01:14:17,468 --> 01:14:21,131
The day you put the idea in my head
I could pilot a ship in space.

1001
01:14:31,482 --> 01:14:35,782
I don't care what happens.
If this gets out to the press--

1002
01:14:35,986 --> 01:14:38,113
It's not about the press right now.

1003
01:14:38,322 --> 01:14:40,290
But whether Roger or Ethan--

1004
01:14:40,591 --> 01:14:43,321
I'm not going up. Not without Hawk.

1005
01:14:44,228 --> 01:14:46,753
- You're gonna blackmail me again?
- No, no.

1006
01:14:47,231 --> 01:14:51,099
I'll teach Ethan what he needs
to know. I don't go if Hawk doesn't.

1007
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:57,064
- Any ideas, Miss Holland?
- Yes.

1008
01:14:57,307 --> 01:15:00,367
Even with the cancer,
he still passed his physical...

1009
01:15:00,577 --> 01:15:05,105
...so there's no reason he can't fly
the mission. Especially with backup.

1010
01:15:05,315 --> 01:15:07,783
You and Frank will put me
in the loony bin.

1011
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:18,856
Colonel Corvin? Miss Holland would
like you to wait here, sir.

1012
01:15:23,534 --> 01:15:26,367
Team Daedalus, all of Team Daedalus...

1013
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:28,834
...has a launch in 92 hours.

1014
01:15:29,606 --> 01:15:33,201
So let's get rested and prepped.

1015
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:35,940
Okay. Yes.

1016
01:15:36,246 --> 01:15:37,440
What's this?

1017
01:15:37,714 --> 01:15:39,011
Have a look.

1018
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:45,187
UTMC-coated, 1.66, super high index
lenses on a Flexon alloy frame.

1019
01:15:45,456 --> 01:15:48,391
- Your prescription.
- My prescription?

1020
01:15:50,494 --> 01:15:52,553
Holy cow.

1021
01:15:52,963 --> 01:15:54,055
Holy cow.

1022
01:15:54,298 --> 01:15:55,959
I had them made for you.

1023
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,927
- You owe me dinner now.
- You'd go out with Spider-Man?

1024
01:16:00,137 --> 01:16:03,504
- If he'll buy me oysters.
- I'll buy you pearls.

1025
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,571
I feel like dancing.

1026
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:41,407
Bring that man back alive!

1027
01:16:41,845 --> 01:16:44,245
No, that's against my better
judgement, Barb.

1028
01:16:47,584 --> 01:16:49,108
I won't let him die.

1029
01:17:09,406 --> 01:17:12,773
General Corvin, General Hawkins,
welcome to Daedalus.

1030
01:17:12,976 --> 01:17:16,537
- We're not generals, son.
- Just saying it like it ought to be.

1031
01:17:36,934 --> 01:17:38,367
You're good to go, men.

1032
01:17:38,569 --> 01:17:41,003
See you back on the ground,
Team Daedalus.

1033
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:43,406
Good luck.

1034
01:17:47,978 --> 01:17:50,572
Well, we've only waited 40 years.

1035
01:17:51,915 --> 01:17:54,850
What do you say, Reverend Tank?
Is a prayer in order?

1036
01:17:55,752 --> 01:17:58,653
I was just reciting
the Shepard's prayer.

1037
01:17:58,855 --> 01:18:00,584
Alan Shepard's prayer.

1038
01:18:01,425 --> 01:18:05,088
"Oh, Lord, please don't let us
screw up."

1039
01:18:05,329 --> 01:18:07,354
- Amen.
- Amen.

1040
01:18:07,564 --> 01:18:08,997
- Amen.
- Amen.

1041
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,968
Amen, Reverend.

1042
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,508
Let's have a comm check.

1043
01:18:24,848 --> 01:18:26,941
- PLT.
- MS One.

1044
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:28,674
- MS Two.
- MS Three.

1045
01:18:28,885 --> 01:18:29,874
MS Four.

1046
01:18:30,287 --> 01:18:33,984
Fido, go. Guidance, go.

1047
01:18:34,858 --> 01:18:36,189
EECOM, go.

1048
01:18:37,127 --> 01:18:38,788
INCO, go.

1049
01:18:52,743 --> 01:18:54,506
T-minus 15 seconds.

1050
01:18:58,682 --> 01:19:02,448
T-minus ten, nine, eight, seven.

1051
01:19:02,653 --> 01:19:04,621
We have a go for main engine start.

1052
01:19:07,424 --> 01:19:11,087
Three, two, one. Ignition.

1053
01:19:24,908 --> 01:19:28,674
Liftoff of space shuttle Daedalus
and STS-200.

1054
01:19:52,269 --> 01:19:53,759
How's it going?

1055
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:56,931
Space will never be the same.

1056
01:20:00,277 --> 01:20:03,269
Houston, this is Daedalus.

1057
01:20:03,547 --> 01:20:05,105
Roll program.

1058
01:20:05,382 --> 01:20:07,213
Roger roll, Daedalus.

1059
01:20:11,788 --> 01:20:13,756
Thank you, God.

1060
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:19,588
Stand by for throttles up.

1061
01:20:19,796 --> 01:20:22,390
Daedalus, you are go
at throttles up.

1062
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:25,133
Roger, Houston. Go with throttles up.

1063
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:33,809
Stand by for separation of SRBs.

1064
01:20:34,644 --> 01:20:36,839
Stand by for SRB sep.

1065
01:20:55,465 --> 01:20:57,524
Coming up to negative return.

1066
01:21:01,338 --> 01:21:02,896
Negative return.

1067
01:21:04,641 --> 01:21:07,872
Roger, Daedalus.
You are negative return.

1068
01:21:08,879 --> 01:21:10,369
We're just a dot.

1069
01:21:15,285 --> 01:21:17,014
Two engines tal.

1070
01:21:19,523 --> 01:21:21,616
Press to ATO.

1071
01:21:23,193 --> 01:21:25,855
Houston, do we have a go
for orbit ops?

1072
01:21:26,062 --> 01:21:29,190
Roger, Daedalus.
You are go for orbit ops.

1073
01:21:29,766 --> 01:21:31,256
Good work, guys.

1074
01:21:34,371 --> 01:21:38,000
Four hours to intercept.
We're right on schedule.

1075
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:40,699
That's not what I'm worried about.

1076
01:21:41,044 --> 01:21:42,568
Relax.

1077
01:21:43,013 --> 01:21:45,038
Our man is up there with them.

1078
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:31,886
It was worth the wait.

1079
01:22:32,295 --> 01:22:33,694
- Yeah, it was.
- Thank you, Frank.

1080
01:22:34,498 --> 01:22:36,159
I owe you one.

1081
01:22:38,168 --> 01:22:40,227
Not a bad takeoff...

1082
01:22:41,638 --> 01:22:43,299
...for some rookies.

1083
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:47,339
You guys are over, over the edge.
You're in space.

1084
01:22:47,544 --> 01:22:50,604
- Welcome to the club.
- Thank you, Roger.

1085
01:22:56,419 --> 01:23:01,356
Okay, Daedalus has got Ikon
on the scopes.

1086
01:23:02,192 --> 01:23:04,854
We should have a visual here
momentarily.

1087
01:23:06,162 --> 01:23:08,027
Range, 5000 meters.

1088
01:23:08,298 --> 01:23:10,892
Roger, Hawk, we have a visual here.

1089
01:23:15,939 --> 01:23:18,169
Stand by for a 15-second burn.

1090
01:23:24,414 --> 01:23:26,746
All right, get ready
to deploy the arm.

1091
01:23:31,421 --> 01:23:33,218
Deploying the arm.

1092
01:23:39,863 --> 01:23:42,331
2200 feet.

1093
01:23:42,966 --> 01:23:45,366
Dead center.
Good driving up there, Hawk.

1094
01:23:45,869 --> 01:23:47,336
Let's light them up.

1095
01:23:47,671 --> 01:23:52,131
Stand by. T.I. burn in four,
three, two, one.

1096
01:23:59,316 --> 01:24:02,308
Hello, Ikon. How we feeling today?

1097
01:24:02,919 --> 01:24:05,217
Activating floods.

1098
01:24:32,949 --> 01:24:35,440
Boy. Will you get a load of this?

1099
01:24:43,727 --> 01:24:45,388
Activating radar.

1100
01:25:25,869 --> 01:25:28,599
- He's trying to get a tone on us.
- What are you saying?

1101
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:31,706
Shut the radar down.
It's painting a target on us.

1102
01:25:31,908 --> 01:25:33,273
Radar off.

1103
01:25:47,123 --> 01:25:48,556
We're okay.

1104
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:53,895
No wonder the damn thing's orbit is
decaying. It's got to weigh 50 ton.

1105
01:25:55,098 --> 01:25:57,658
Houston, this is Daedalus.
You see what we see?

1106
01:25:57,867 --> 01:25:59,767
Roger, Daedalus. We are...

1107
01:25:59,969 --> 01:26:02,267
...studying it from here.

1108
01:26:02,972 --> 01:26:04,769
Stand by for a decision.

1109
01:26:08,478 --> 01:26:11,811
It's got to have some kind of
self-defense mechanism.

1110
01:26:12,015 --> 01:26:14,711
Our radar must've activated it.

1111
01:26:16,953 --> 01:26:18,113
Can you grab it?

1112
01:26:19,122 --> 01:26:21,647
I can get it if Hawk
can get us in there.

1113
01:26:23,126 --> 01:26:24,957
I'm just worried about the mass.

1114
01:26:25,161 --> 01:26:27,823
I'm worried about this thing
getting pissed again.

1115
01:26:35,205 --> 01:26:37,969
Does that look like a communications
satellite to you?

1116
01:26:38,174 --> 01:26:41,632
General, what sort of modifications
have your people made here?

1117
01:26:44,247 --> 01:26:47,478
That grappling arm can't
handle that much stress.

1118
01:26:47,984 --> 01:26:51,112
It's within operational limits.
Frank can latch on.

1119
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:52,845
I don't know about this.

1120
01:26:53,056 --> 01:26:56,617
Our mission is to restore this
satellite. Let's get on with it.

1121
01:26:56,826 --> 01:26:59,659
I won't let this crew get killed,
you included.

1122
01:27:05,502 --> 01:27:08,130
Houston, Daedalus.
We're still standing by.

1123
01:27:10,673 --> 01:27:13,642
- Give them a go to capture.
- Daedalus, this is Houston.

1124
01:27:13,843 --> 01:27:16,038
You have a go for capture.

1125
01:27:16,246 --> 01:27:18,407
- Here we go, gentlemen.
- Roger, Houston.

1126
01:27:19,349 --> 01:27:22,876
We have a go for capture.
Pull it in, see what she looks like.

1127
01:27:23,086 --> 01:27:25,213
Give me a minute to get it stable.

1128
01:27:56,486 --> 01:27:58,044
Okay, how does that look?

1129
01:27:58,755 --> 01:28:00,382
That's close enough for me.

1130
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:03,354
- Is he as good as you say he is?
- Tank?

1131
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,993
He's the man.

1132
01:28:08,298 --> 01:28:11,028
All right. You can go for it.

1133
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:15,904
You're drifting left too far.

1134
01:28:19,943 --> 01:28:24,039
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1135
01:28:26,416 --> 01:28:30,045
Holy shit!
I got it!

1136
01:28:33,857 --> 01:28:34,846
You the man, Tank.

1137
01:28:35,091 --> 01:28:37,582
Houston, Daedalus. We've got Ikon.

1138
01:28:38,862 --> 01:28:40,454
Good work, fellas.

1139
01:28:52,375 --> 01:28:54,366
You boys look mighty sharp.

1140
01:30:33,242 --> 01:30:37,508
Welcome to space, Frank.
You've waited a while for this.

1141
01:30:38,381 --> 01:30:41,578
Yeah. Only 40 years.

1142
01:30:55,999 --> 01:30:59,867
All right, cowboys. Let's round
them up. We got work to do.

1143
01:31:50,119 --> 01:31:52,087
A little light on the subject.

1144
01:31:52,855 --> 01:31:54,789
We'll take a look at its brains.

1145
01:31:58,928 --> 01:32:00,589
I don't think that's the panel.

1146
01:32:01,631 --> 01:32:02,791
You don't, do you?

1147
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:40,064
Holy cow, Frank.

1148
01:32:40,369 --> 01:32:43,532
This is some piece of junk.

1149
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:09,355
This isn't a sightseeing trip, Frank.

1150
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:26,147
- Abort activity.
- Frank, listen to me.

1151
01:33:26,349 --> 01:33:29,182
I said, abort activity. Now.

1152
01:33:39,462 --> 01:33:41,396
What's going on, Frank?

1153
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,466
Ethan, what the hell's going on?
What is this damn thing?

1154
01:33:54,677 --> 01:33:57,145
A Russian communications satellite,
colonel.

1155
01:33:57,346 --> 01:34:01,373
Bullshit! You don't think I know a
nuclear launch platform when I see it?

1156
01:34:01,584 --> 01:34:05,076
Why are we helping the Russians
put a missile silo back into orbit?

1157
01:34:05,454 --> 01:34:07,615
You're a genius. You figure it out.

1158
01:34:09,859 --> 01:34:12,327
You're only here
as a publicity stunt!

1159
01:34:12,628 --> 01:34:15,153
You got what you wanted!
You're in space!

1160
01:34:15,364 --> 01:34:17,389
Now finish the damn mission!

1161
01:34:22,605 --> 01:34:23,970
Go ahead, Frank.

1162
01:34:24,173 --> 01:34:26,368
You're on a secure line now.

1163
01:34:26,742 --> 01:34:30,576
You were right to be concerned
about this thing coming out of orbit.

1164
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:34,147
It happens to have six armed
nuclear warheads on board.

1165
01:34:37,453 --> 01:34:38,818
What's he talking about?

1166
01:34:39,021 --> 01:34:40,648
I have no idea.

1167
01:34:40,856 --> 01:34:43,347
General, is there something
you want to tell us?

1168
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:46,225
Yes.

1169
01:34:47,496 --> 01:34:50,727
Ikon is a relic from the Cold War.

1170
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:55,760
It has floated dead in space
ever since the Soviet Union fell.

1171
01:34:56,505 --> 01:34:58,905
There are six missiles on board...

1172
01:34:59,108 --> 01:35:02,669
...targeted at strategic
American installations.

1173
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:05,312
All, most regrettably...

1174
01:35:05,514 --> 01:35:07,141
...in large metropolitan areas.

1175
01:35:07,984 --> 01:35:09,611
If Ikon goes offline...

1176
01:35:09,952 --> 01:35:11,510
...it will assume that...

1177
01:35:11,988 --> 01:35:16,322
...there has been a catastrophe
and will initiate launch on its own.

1178
01:35:16,559 --> 01:35:19,653
You picked a hell of a time
for a confession, general.

1179
01:35:19,862 --> 01:35:21,796
Those are our boys up there.

1180
01:35:21,998 --> 01:35:25,866
And that is a treaty violation.
A goddamn big one.

1181
01:35:26,068 --> 01:35:27,763
You bastard.

1182
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:32,066
Bob, you don't know how touched I am
that you're worried about our safety.

1183
01:35:32,441 --> 01:35:35,171
Why don't you ask your friend
the general...

1184
01:35:35,378 --> 01:35:39,337
...how my guidance system from
Skylab got aboard this six-gun?

1185
01:35:41,517 --> 01:35:44,077
It was stolen by the KGB...

1186
01:35:44,287 --> 01:35:47,586
...from Mr.Gerson's personal files.

1187
01:35:51,961 --> 01:35:54,122
This is all news to me.

1188
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:59,358
You'd have us put it back into orbit
fully armed and keep it a secret...

1189
01:35:59,568 --> 01:36:01,331
...just to save your ass?

1190
01:36:03,939 --> 01:36:06,737
People, we have a real problem here.

1191
01:36:11,847 --> 01:36:13,007
All right, huddle up.

1192
01:36:13,316 --> 01:36:14,908
We got a big-ass problem.

1193
01:36:15,117 --> 01:36:19,417
We're latched on to a 100-megaton
bomb traveling 17,000 miles an hour.

1194
01:36:22,058 --> 01:36:26,017
What about that shit heap? You think
we can get it out into deep space?

1195
01:36:26,228 --> 01:36:29,629
Four payload assist rockets? Just.

1196
01:36:29,865 --> 01:36:33,096
Maybe. I don't know.
Let me crunch some numbers.

1197
01:36:39,075 --> 01:36:40,508
Just okay, Frank.

1198
01:36:43,346 --> 01:36:45,371
Somebody's outside the ship.

1199
01:36:45,581 --> 01:36:49,813
Daedalus, you have an unscheduled
EVA you want to tell me about?

1200
01:36:50,386 --> 01:36:51,216
What?

1201
01:37:00,563 --> 01:37:02,929
He's jammed the air lock door, Frank.

1202
01:37:03,299 --> 01:37:05,324
Remove the panel and override it.

1203
01:37:10,473 --> 01:37:11,997
Turn on the lights.

1204
01:37:15,277 --> 01:37:17,404
Ethan, what are you doing out there?

1205
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:22,974
Ethan, what are you doing?

1206
01:37:23,285 --> 01:37:24,912
Your job, Frank.

1207
01:37:25,821 --> 01:37:28,016
Putting Ikon back into geosync orbit.

1208
01:37:31,527 --> 01:37:34,860
You don't know what you're doing.
Come back. That's an order.

1209
01:37:35,398 --> 01:37:37,730
You don't know the sequencing.

1210
01:37:40,603 --> 01:37:43,595
Get suited up. When the door's fixed,
get out there.

1211
01:37:43,806 --> 01:37:45,034
All right.

1212
01:37:54,984 --> 01:37:58,886
Ethan, do not connect those PAM
rockets. Do you understand?

1213
01:38:01,157 --> 01:38:02,055
How long?

1214
01:38:02,258 --> 01:38:03,282
I nearly got it.

1215
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:10,390
Don't lock onto those PAM rockets.
You hear me?

1216
01:38:19,708 --> 01:38:20,606
Got it.

1217
01:38:50,539 --> 01:38:51,733
It's arming itself.

1218
01:39:10,993 --> 01:39:12,187
Oh, God!

1219
01:39:26,775 --> 01:39:28,106
Oh, Lord.

1220
01:39:44,293 --> 01:39:45,317
- Hawk.
- I'm on it.

1221
01:40:34,677 --> 01:40:36,668
Shit, we got a fire in here.

1222
01:40:41,016 --> 01:40:42,608
We lost Ikon and Ethan.

1223
01:40:49,191 --> 01:40:51,955
Roger's hurt, mid-deck.
He's bleeding badly.

1224
01:40:52,528 --> 01:40:54,621
See what you can do for him.

1225
01:40:54,830 --> 01:40:58,357
Tank, contain the situation.
Kill the 02 switch.

1226
01:40:58,567 --> 01:40:59,397
Killing it.

1227
01:40:59,602 --> 01:41:01,536
Hawk and I are going out.

1228
01:41:01,737 --> 01:41:02,999
I got it.

1229
01:41:09,144 --> 01:41:11,135
Status GBC.

1230
01:41:11,714 --> 01:41:12,874
Check.

1231
01:41:13,115 --> 01:41:14,912
They've got the fire contained.

1232
01:41:15,117 --> 01:41:18,177
Range, 100 feet. It's accelerating,
Miss Holland.

1233
01:41:18,387 --> 01:41:20,184
They're gonna lose it.

1234
01:41:20,623 --> 01:41:22,181
I assume you got a plan.

1235
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:27,192
I think I can reconfigure the flight
control system for stabilization burn.

1236
01:41:27,396 --> 01:41:30,661
The only trouble is, I gotta do that
at exactly the right time.

1237
01:41:31,066 --> 01:41:32,533
That's where you come in.

1238
01:41:32,735 --> 01:41:34,862
You gotta be my eyes
while I'm in there.

1239
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:38,733
Cue me when the satellite comes around
and lines up with the shuttle.

1240
01:41:38,941 --> 01:41:41,535
But what about the rate of descent?

1241
01:41:41,744 --> 01:41:46,181
I'll fire a short burst from the PAM,
and that'll counter-thrust.

1242
01:41:46,382 --> 01:41:49,112
Just enable the PAM rocket
to accept my command.

1243
01:41:49,318 --> 01:41:51,809
Hell, I thought this
was gonna be hard.

1244
01:41:52,021 --> 01:41:53,750
Jerry, to make all this work...

1245
01:41:53,956 --> 01:41:56,447
...give me range and rate
of opening readings.

1246
01:41:56,859 --> 01:41:59,350
Frank, you have one shot, maybe.

1247
01:41:59,561 --> 01:42:01,756
You miss, you'll never make it back.

1248
01:42:02,097 --> 01:42:05,498
If those bombs hit the atmosphere,
it might not matter anyway.

1249
01:42:05,701 --> 01:42:08,727
Come on, let's suit up
and get out of here.

1250
01:42:15,544 --> 01:42:18,069
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

1251
01:43:05,194 --> 01:43:06,627
2200 feet.

1252
01:43:20,209 --> 01:43:23,838
Holy cow. This is a bad idea.

1253
01:43:26,348 --> 01:43:29,442
Frank, by my calculations,
you got 15 seconds...

1254
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:31,516
...to ignite that PAM.

1255
01:43:35,858 --> 01:43:38,986
- Speak to me, Hawk.
- We're almost there, Frank.

1256
01:43:41,964 --> 01:43:42,794
Five.

1257
01:43:42,998 --> 01:43:44,898
- On a count of one.
- Four.

1258
01:43:45,334 --> 01:43:46,733
- One.
- Three.

1259
01:43:47,069 --> 01:43:49,299
Two, one.

1260
01:44:26,375 --> 01:44:28,570
On my mark, Frank, shut her down.

1261
01:44:37,519 --> 01:44:39,282
Five, four...

1262
01:44:39,955 --> 01:44:40,785
...three...

1263
01:44:40,989 --> 01:44:42,047
Come on, Frank.

1264
01:44:42,257 --> 01:44:44,122
...two, one...

1265
01:44:44,326 --> 01:44:45,293
...mark.

1266
01:44:56,338 --> 01:44:58,101
That's it, Frank. It's static.

1267
01:45:02,578 --> 01:45:05,411
Houston, this is Daedalus.
We've arrested the fall.

1268
01:45:05,614 --> 01:45:06,945
Attaboy, Frank!

1269
01:45:07,149 --> 01:45:08,878
Oh, thank God.

1270
01:45:13,789 --> 01:45:15,416
Son of a bitch.

1271
01:45:25,267 --> 01:45:26,097
He's out.

1272
01:45:30,706 --> 01:45:34,836
I'll hook up the extra Payload Assist
Modules. You take Jonny Quest back.

1273
01:45:39,081 --> 01:45:42,175
We've got a problem.
We've only got one rocket left.

1274
01:45:43,151 --> 01:45:46,518
One PAM's got no chance of getting
that thing into orbit, Frank.

1275
01:45:52,494 --> 01:45:54,189
You got another problem.

1276
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:58,590
Oh, no. Even if we get
this thing going...

1277
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,497
...it's not gonna have enough power
with two broken panels.

1278
01:46:03,038 --> 01:46:04,938
Take the kid back, I'll handle this.

1279
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:08,776
How will you handle it, professor?
You're a pilot, remember?

1280
01:46:09,177 --> 01:46:12,305
I'll need all the extra O2 modules
you've got.

1281
01:46:13,682 --> 01:46:15,479
What are you talking about?

1282
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:20,151
No.

1283
01:46:21,623 --> 01:46:24,888
I love you, but why do you
have to be such a killjoy?

1284
01:46:25,093 --> 01:46:27,357
Besides, you ever see a prettier moon?

1285
01:46:32,968 --> 01:46:34,697
What's he talking about, Frank?

1286
01:46:39,574 --> 01:46:42,042
You'd never make
a quarter of a million miles.

1287
01:46:42,244 --> 01:46:43,643
Oh, hell, yes, I will.

1288
01:46:43,845 --> 01:46:47,110
I just gotta go halfway.
The moon's gravity will do the rest.

1289
01:46:47,316 --> 01:46:50,080
I'll fire them into outer space
and let them...

1290
01:46:53,989 --> 01:46:55,616
...self-destruct.

1291
01:46:59,027 --> 01:47:03,964
That's not a solution, Frank. One PAM
rocket's not nearly enough thrust.

1292
01:47:04,166 --> 01:47:07,761
Let's everybody slow down.
There's got to be another way.

1293
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:09,501
There isn't.

1294
01:47:10,305 --> 01:47:11,431
No.

1295
01:47:14,142 --> 01:47:15,370
No.

1296
01:47:15,877 --> 01:47:19,335
Gotta be a winner in every race.
Looks like it's me this time.

1297
01:47:21,383 --> 01:47:23,283
As usual, huh?

1298
01:47:24,353 --> 01:47:25,752
Oh, shit.

1299
01:48:28,483 --> 01:48:30,781
- He can't do that.
- What's the status here?

1300
01:48:30,986 --> 01:48:32,783
What's the status here?

1301
01:48:33,088 --> 01:48:36,546
One orbital engine gone,
primary and secondary guidance system.

1302
01:48:36,758 --> 01:48:39,158
Hydraulics are questionable.

1303
01:48:39,494 --> 01:48:40,518
Roger?

1304
01:48:41,797 --> 01:48:43,355
He has a concussion.

1305
01:48:44,766 --> 01:48:46,393
Oh, God.

1306
01:48:52,874 --> 01:48:56,105
With no Roger and no Hawk, Frank...

1307
01:48:56,311 --> 01:48:58,609
...you'll have to pilot this bird
by yourself.

1308
01:48:58,814 --> 01:49:01,476
And you'll have to do it dead-stick.

1309
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:09,218
Don't look at me. I've flown nothing
bigger than a Cessna in 30 years.

1310
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:15,057
Looks like I'm getting the better part
of the deal here.

1311
01:49:16,865 --> 01:49:20,028
Stop laughing.
You used up all your oxygen, dummy.

1312
01:49:43,158 --> 01:49:44,750
Frank's hot-wired it for you...

1313
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:49,488
...but the trick is, those missiles
run out of fuel in 20,000 miles.

1314
01:49:49,764 --> 01:49:51,425
You launch them too soon...

1315
01:49:51,633 --> 01:49:54,568
...the warheads could find
their way back home to Earth.

1316
01:49:54,769 --> 01:49:59,138
Too late, they'd run out of fuel
and then you'd be stuck with them.

1317
01:50:00,675 --> 01:50:02,006
Is this gonna work?

1318
01:50:04,646 --> 01:50:05,670
I don't know.

1319
01:50:06,481 --> 01:50:07,675
All right, fellas...

1320
01:50:08,216 --> 01:50:10,343
...let's shoot this baby to the moon.

1321
01:50:13,088 --> 01:50:14,783
Count down to one, right?

1322
01:50:15,357 --> 01:50:16,790
On a count of one.

1323
01:50:36,044 --> 01:50:36,874
One.

1324
01:51:35,136 --> 01:51:37,104
Ikon has left our gravitational field.

1325
01:51:37,305 --> 01:51:41,139
Hawk was able to launch the warheads
into outer space.

1326
01:51:41,343 --> 01:51:42,867
How's Daedalus?

1327
01:51:43,545 --> 01:51:45,775
We have a critical situation.

1328
01:51:47,582 --> 01:51:51,416
The collision left us with one good
orbital maneuvering engine...

1329
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:53,679
...and it's leaking fuel.

1330
01:51:54,522 --> 01:51:57,320
If there's not enough fuel
for a de-orbit burn...

1331
01:51:57,993 --> 01:52:00,553
It'll burn up, or it'll skip off.

1332
01:52:01,396 --> 01:52:03,387
What about guidance and avionics?

1333
01:52:03,832 --> 01:52:06,528
Well, the computers are unresponsive.

1334
01:52:06,935 --> 01:52:10,769
The only thing operating
at 100 percent is their air flow.

1335
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:16,541
They're gonna have to reenter the
atmosphere and set her down in manual.

1336
01:52:16,745 --> 01:52:20,511
- That's impossible.
- Well, it's never happened before.

1337
01:52:22,651 --> 01:52:27,020
The only pilots alive who'd even think
about it are Roger and Hawk.

1338
01:52:28,023 --> 01:52:30,856
- Roger's wounded and Hawk's--
- Okay.

1339
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:34,852
Let's get them as close as we can,
then abort the landing.

1340
01:52:35,463 --> 01:52:39,399
They'll have to bail out.
What are the survival probabilities?

1341
01:52:41,970 --> 01:52:43,904
20 percent at best.

1342
01:52:44,105 --> 01:52:48,405
Zero if they try to set it down.
The bird's dead.

1343
01:52:49,110 --> 01:52:52,443
I doubt it would even glide,
with its structural damage.

1344
01:52:54,683 --> 01:52:57,015
20 percent is better than zero.

1345
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:16,799
- You still have that thing?
- Yes. She'll dance all the way home.

1346
01:53:22,277 --> 01:53:23,107
Daedalus.

1347
01:53:23,411 --> 01:53:25,675
Stand by for Eugene Davis.

1348
01:53:28,049 --> 01:53:30,540
The judgement here is to go for Florida.

1349
01:53:31,786 --> 01:53:34,254
We'll get you as close to Kennedy
as we can.

1350
01:53:34,656 --> 01:53:38,820
Now, you're still inverted.
And you're flying tail-first.

1351
01:53:39,427 --> 01:53:43,420
Ordinarily, the autopilot would
do a de-orbit burn to right you.

1352
01:53:44,299 --> 01:53:47,962
- But we don't have a computer, right?
- That's right.

1353
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:51,898
You don't have much fuel left
in that engine, either.

1354
01:53:53,007 --> 01:53:54,440
Swell.

1355
01:53:54,709 --> 01:53:57,007
Stand by for de-orbit burn.

1356
01:54:10,258 --> 01:54:13,921
That wasn't enough. Flip us around
and use the forward RCS prop.

1357
01:54:14,129 --> 01:54:15,357
Shit.

1358
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:17,227
All right.

1359
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:32,941
Shit.

1360
01:54:33,581 --> 01:54:36,948
Easy, Frank. She's not a fighter jet.

1361
01:54:37,719 --> 01:54:39,653
A flying brick.

1362
01:54:40,755 --> 01:54:42,188
I hope not.

1363
01:55:01,576 --> 01:55:03,806
I'm gonna put her in a steep dive.

1364
01:55:04,145 --> 01:55:06,204
Make sure we don't overshoot.

1365
01:55:12,053 --> 01:55:14,283
I'll make a series of tight turns.

1366
01:55:14,489 --> 01:55:16,684
Spill off some of this speed.

1367
01:55:17,358 --> 01:55:22,057
Jerry, clip everybody in. At about
10,000, we should be over Florida.

1368
01:55:22,263 --> 01:55:24,390
Pop the hatch and get
everybody out of here.

1369
01:55:25,066 --> 01:55:26,431
Ethan and Roger first.

1370
01:55:27,035 --> 01:55:29,230
Tank, you and Jerry after that.

1371
01:55:29,437 --> 01:55:33,203
I'll line her up for a ditch over
the ocean. You got that, everyone?

1372
01:55:43,184 --> 01:55:44,845
Come on, hold together.

1373
01:55:45,053 --> 01:55:47,214
You're going in too steep, Frank.

1374
01:55:50,592 --> 01:55:52,389
She'll fall apart around us.

1375
01:55:52,594 --> 01:55:54,562
Hold together just a little longer.

1376
01:56:14,749 --> 01:56:18,082
Altitude 30 miles over Texas.

1377
01:56:29,564 --> 01:56:31,429
Come on, just a little longer.

1378
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:37,170
Give me one more turn.

1379
01:56:58,626 --> 01:57:00,116
He's trying to call, sir.

1380
01:57:00,495 --> 01:57:02,429
He's fried his antenna.

1381
01:57:02,897 --> 01:57:04,262
Trajectory, where is he?

1382
01:57:04,465 --> 01:57:07,662
He's on final, but way too hot.
He'll overshoot at this rate.

1383
01:57:16,778 --> 01:57:18,769
Coming up on 12,000.

1384
01:57:20,248 --> 01:57:21,374
Equalizing.

1385
01:57:22,417 --> 01:57:25,682
Jerry, blow that hatch.
Get everybody out of here.

1386
01:57:25,887 --> 01:57:27,184
Roger.

1387
01:57:27,655 --> 01:57:28,679
Blowing the hatch.

1388
01:57:41,869 --> 01:57:42,699
One gone.

1389
01:57:43,671 --> 01:57:45,536
Tank, you get going too.

1390
01:57:46,407 --> 01:57:47,374
What about you?

1391
01:57:47,575 --> 01:57:49,839
I'll line her up for a visual,
then I'm out.

1392
01:57:53,915 --> 01:57:54,745
Two gone.

1393
01:57:56,451 --> 01:57:59,579
Get out of here. Do you hear me?
Get moving.

1394
01:58:03,558 --> 01:58:05,150
What the hell you guys doing?

1395
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:07,260
We're a team, Frank.

1396
01:58:08,262 --> 01:58:10,162
Get out of here. That's an order.

1397
01:58:10,765 --> 01:58:12,392
We're staying.

1398
01:58:14,869 --> 01:58:16,598
Read out my airspeed, then.

1399
01:58:17,672 --> 01:58:20,334
500. Bring her up.

1400
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:28,043
This is Recover Five.
You're way too hot.

1401
01:58:28,249 --> 01:58:29,216
Pull out now.

1402
01:58:29,784 --> 01:58:30,910
Negative, Recover.

1403
01:58:33,521 --> 01:58:34,886
All right, give me airspeed.

1404
01:58:36,524 --> 01:58:37,855
300. Gear coming.

1405
01:58:38,526 --> 01:58:39,720
Gear down.

1406
01:58:39,961 --> 01:58:44,455
All right, there's nothing to this.
Just tap the brakes a little bit.

1407
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:54,105
He's gone into a stall.

1408
01:59:02,483 --> 01:59:03,472
Airspeed?

1409
01:59:03,818 --> 01:59:05,183
220.

1410
01:59:05,887 --> 01:59:06,876
210.

1411
01:59:08,089 --> 01:59:09,317
200.

1412
01:59:09,891 --> 01:59:12,416
185. She's gonna stall, Frank.

1413
01:59:16,898 --> 01:59:17,922
Speed?

1414
01:59:18,533 --> 01:59:20,763
175. Drop the nose.

1415
01:59:21,002 --> 01:59:23,300
What do you say we drop the nose?

1416
02:00:09,817 --> 02:00:13,309
Wheels stopped. Daedalus is home.

1417
02:00:29,504 --> 02:00:31,563
Just a walk in the park, Frank.

1418
02:01:01,135 --> 02:01:02,466
Hey, Gene.

1419
02:01:03,504 --> 02:01:05,836
- Yeah?
- Never mind.

1420
02:01:08,276 --> 02:01:10,574
I never doubted Frank Corvin
for a minute.

1421
02:01:11,445 --> 02:01:15,074
I brought him in on Project Daedalus
40 years ago and on this one too.

1422
02:01:15,283 --> 02:01:19,185
I'll tell you this: For commitment,
courage and consistency...

1423
02:01:19,387 --> 02:01:22,550
...this group blows away
all the teams I've ever had.

1424
02:01:34,602 --> 02:01:36,331
Do you think he made it?

1425
02:01:42,176 --> 02:01:44,906
Yeah. I think he made it.

1426
02:01:52,286 --> 02:01:55,119
Fly me to the moon

1427
02:01:55,323 --> 02:02:00,090
Let me play among the stars

1428
02:02:00,294 --> 02:02:04,628
Let me see what spring is like

1429
02:02:05,266 --> 02:02:07,996
On Jupiter and Mars

1430
02:02:08,336 --> 02:02:10,304
In other words

1431
02:02:11,372 --> 02:02:15,365
Hold my hand

1432
02:02:16,477 --> 02:02:18,411
In other words

1433
02:02:19,547 --> 02:02:22,209
Baby, kiss me

1434
02:02:24,585 --> 02:02:27,110
Fill my heart with song

1435
02:02:27,321 --> 02:02:31,724
And let me sing forevermore

1436
02:02:32,727 --> 02:02:35,696
You are all I long for

1437
02:02:35,897 --> 02:02:39,856
All I worship and adore

1438
02:02:40,868 --> 02:02:42,836
In other words

1439
02:02:43,537 --> 02:02:46,904
Please be true

1440
02:02:49,043 --> 02:02:51,238
In other words

1441
02:02:51,445 --> 02:02:54,744
I love you

1442
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,126
